Considering that most aquaculture activities take place in open or natural habitats that are vulnerable to environmental changes. Promising findings from recent research conducted on various aquaculture species have provided preliminary evidence suggesting a link between epigenetic mechanisms and economically valuable characteristics. Environmental stressors, including climate changes (thermal stress, hypoxia, and water salinity), anthropogenic impacts such as (pesticides, crude oil pollution, nutritional impacts, and heavy metal) and abiotic factors (infectious diseases), can directly trigger epigenetic modifications in fish. While experiments have confirmed that many epigenetic alterations caused by environmental factors have plastic responses, some can be permanently integrated into the genome through genetic integration and promoting rapid transgenerational adaptation in fish. These environmental factors might cause irregular DNA methylation patterns in genes related to many biological events leading to organs dysfunction by inducing alterations in genes related to oxidative stress or apoptosis. Moreover, these environmental issues alter DNA/histone methylation leading to decreased reproductive competence. This review emphasizes the importance of understanding the effects of environmentally relevant issues on the epigenetic regulation of phenotypic variations in fish. The goal is to expand our knowledge of how epigenetics can either facilitate or hinder species' adaptation to these adverse conditions. Furthermore, this review outlines the areas that warrant further investigation in understanding epigenetic reactions to various environmental issues.},

Inbred depression is common in plants and animals and has played a significant role in evolution. In the review, we aim to show that inbreeding can, through the action of epigenetic mechanisms, affect gene expression, resulting in changes in the metabolism and phenotype of organisms. This is particularly important in plant breeding because epigenetic profiles can be linked to the deterioration or improvement of agriculturally important characteristics.},

  abstract = {The deleterious effects of inbreeding have been of extreme importance to evolutionary biology, but it has been difficult to characterize the complex interactions between genetic constraints and selection that lead to fitness loss and recovery after inbreeding. Haploid organisms and selfing organisms like the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans are capable of rapid recovery from the fixation of novel deleterious mutation; however, the potential for recovery and genomic consequences of inbreeding in diploid, outcrossing organisms are not well understood. We sought to answer two questions: 1) Can a diploid, outcrossing population recover from inbreeding via standing genetic variation and new mutation? and 2) How does allelic diversity change during recovery? We inbred C. remanei, an outcrossing relative of C. elegans, through brother-sister mating for 30 generations followed by recovery at large population size. Inbreeding reduced fitness but, surprisingly, recovery from inbreeding at large populations sizes generated only very moderate fitness recovery after 300 generations. We found that 65\% of ancestral single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were fixed in the inbred population, far fewer than the theoretical expectation of \$99\%. Under recovery, 36 SNPs across 30 genes involved in alimentary, muscular, nervous, and reproductive systems changed reproducibly across replicates, indicating that strong selection for fitness recovery does exist. Our results indicate that recovery from inbreeding depression via standing genetic variation and mutation is likely to be constrained by the large number of segregating deleterious variants present in natural populations, limiting the capacity for recovery of small populations.},

  abstract = {The social web has enabled individuals from all walks of life to openly express their emotions and sentiment in relation to current affairs, local issues and personal circumstances. Within the social web, social media encompasses deep emotional expressions that reflect a multitude of personalities and behaviors. Existing research in this space is heavily focused on supervised sentiment analysis and emotion detection, with limited work on modeling these deep emotions, mixed emotions and variations of emotional behaviors from unlabeled and unstructured social media conversations. In this study, we propose a comprehensive framework based on the principles of self-structuring artificial intelligence for emotion modeling and analysis that systematically integrates the modeling capabilities at a granular level on unstructured, unlabeled social media data. The research contributions of this framework are the detection, analysis and synthesis of deep emotion intensity, emotion transitions, emotion latent representations, and profile-based emotion classification. The self-structuring artificial intelligence framework amalgamates an ensemble of novel algorithms to eventuate these contributions. These algorithms extend the current state-of-the-art of natural language processing techniques, word embedding, Markov chains and growing self-organizing maps, specifically for deep emotions modeling and analysis. The framework is empirically evaluated on anonymized conversations from online mental health support forums. The outcomes identify profile-based emotion characteristics, emotion intensities, transitions and an overall latent representation across three distinct mental health groups in these forums. These outcomes are comprehensive in comparison to existing work which singularly focuses on sentiment analysis or emotion detection. The validity and effectiveness of its application on a real-world social media setting further establish the methodological novelty of this ensemble of self-structuring artificial intelligence for deep emotions.},

  abstract = {Causal loss-of-function (LOF) variants for Mendelian and severe complex diseases are enriched in 'mutation intolerant' genes. We show how such observations can be interpreted in light of a model of mutation-selection balance and use the model to relate the pathogenic consequences of LOF mutations at present to their evolutionary fitness effects. To this end, we first infer posterior distributions for the fitness costs of LOF mutations in 17,318 autosomal and 679 X-linked genes from exome sequences in 56,855 individuals. Estimated fitness costs for the loss of a gene copy are typically above 1\%; they tend to be largest for X-linked genes, whether or not they have a Y homolog, followed by autosomal genes and genes in the pseudoautosomal region. We compare inferred fitness effects for all possible de novo LOF mutations to those of de novo mutations identified in individuals diagnosed with one of six severe, complex diseases or developmental disorders. Probands carry an excess of mutations with estimated fitness effects above 10\%; as we show by simulation, when sampled in the population, such highly deleterious mutations are typically only a couple of generations old. Moreover, the proportion of highly deleterious mutations carried by probands reflects the typical age of onset of the disease. The study design also has a discernible influence: a greater proportion of highly deleterious mutations is detected in pedigree than case-control studies, and for autism, in simplex than multiplex families and in female versus male probands. Thus, anchoring observations in human genetics to a population genetic model allows us to learn about the fitness effects of mutations identified by different mapping strategies and for different traits.},

These alleles, most of which are of small effect individually, collectively can reduce substantially the fitness of individuals relative to what it would be otherwise; this is mutation load. Mutation load can be lessened by any factor that causes more mutations to be removed per selective death, such as inbreeding, synergistic epistasis, population structure, or harsh environments. The ecological effects of load are not clear-cut because some conditions (such as selection early in life, sexual selection, reproductive compensation, and intraspecific competition) reduce the effects of load on population size and persistence, but other conditions (such as interspecific competition and load on resource use efficiency) can cause small amounts of load to have strong effects on the population, even extinction. We suggest a series of studies to improve our understanding of the effects of mutation load.},

The heritability is almost the same (0.50 {\textpm} 0.22) for offspring transferred to other nests and reared by foster parents, whereas there is no resemblance (0.04 {\textpm} 0.23) between the offspring and their foster mothers. Hence, the nest environment does not affect parent-offspring resemblance. However, a full-sib correlation yields an estimate of the heritability twice as high as the parent-offspring regression did, indicating that shared environment effects, which are not correlated with the tarsus length of parents, must be important. An environmental deviation due to food factors affecting tarsus length is demonstrated. The most important food factors are probably associated with I) polygyny, which leads to reduced paternal feeding at secondary nests, 2) high breeding density, and 3) progress ofthe breeding season. All three are associated with reductions in offspring mean tarsus length.},

Hunting and fishing contrast with agricultural and aquacultural practices in which the most desirable animals are typically bred with the specific goal of increasing the frequency of desirable phenotypes. We consider the potential effects of harvest on the genetics and sustainability of wild populations. We also consider how harvesting could affect the mating system and thereby modify sexual selection in a way that might affect recruitment. Determining whether phenotypic changes in harvested populations are due to evolution, rather than phenotypic plasticity or environmental variation, has been problematic. Nevertheless, it is likely that some undesirable changes observed over time in exploited populations (e.g., reduced body size, earlier sexual maturity, reduced antler size, etc.) are due to selection against desirable phenotypes---a process we call ``unnatural'' selection. Evolution brought about by human harvest might greatly increase the time required for over-harvested populations to recover once harvest is curtailed because harvesting often creates strong selection differentials, whereas curtailing harvest will often result in less intense selection in the opposing direction. We strongly encourage those responsible for managing harvested wild populations to take into account possible selective effects of harvest management and to implement monitoring programs to detect exploitation-induced selection before it seriously impacts viability.},

However, the proximal mechanisms of these costs remain poorly understood. Free radicals arising as by-products of normal metabolic activities have deleterious effects on cellular proteins, lipids and DNA, and this phenomenon is known as oxidative stress. Since reproduction is an energetically demanding activity, which increases both basal and field metabolic rates, one could expect that breeding effort generates an oxidative stress whose strength depends on the availability and efficiency of antioxidant defences. In agreement with this prediction, we show here for the first time that reproduction decreases antioxidant defences, illustrating that oxidative stress represents a cost of reproduction. We suggest that increased susceptibility to oxidative stress might be a general proximal connection between reproduction and survival underlying other mechanistic links previously acknowledged.},

Using randomized baseline models, we establish the presence of homophily in ethnicity, gender and affiliation. We then study the effect of diversity on scientific impact, as reflected in citations. Remarkably, of the classes considered, ethnic diversity had the strongest correlation with scientific impact. To further isolate the effects of ethnic diversity, we used randomized baseline models and again found a clear link between diversity and impact. To further support these findings, we use coarsened exact matching to compare the scientific impact of ethnically diverse papers and scientists with closely-matched control groups. Here, we find that ethnic diversity resulted in an impact gain of 10.63\% for papers, and 47.67\% for scientists.},

In a follow up experiment, queenless workers whose genomes had experimentally altered methylation were more aggressive and more likely to develop ovaries compared with control queenless workers. This shows methylation is important in this highly plastic reproductive division of labour. Methylation is an epigenetic tag for genomic imprinting (GI).

  abstract = {Aging, for virtually all life, is inescapable. However, within populations, biological aging rates vary. Understanding sources of variation in this process is central to understanding the biodemography of natural populations. We constructed a DNA methylation-based age predictor for an intensively studied wild baboon population in Kenya. Consistent with findings in humans, the resulting `epigenetic clock' closely tracks chronological age, but individuals are predicted to be somewhat older or younger than their known ages. Surprisingly, these deviations are not explained by the strongest predictors of lifespan in this population, early adversity and social integration. Instead, they are best predicted by male dominance rank: high-ranking males are predicted to be older than their true ages, and epigenetic age tracks changes in rank over time. Our results argue that achieving high rank for male baboons -- the best predictor of reproductive success -- imposes costs consistent with a `live fast, die young' life-history strategy.           ,              For most animals, age is one of the strongest predictors of health and survival, but not all individuals age at the same rate. In fact, animals of the same species can have different 'biological ages' even when they have lived the same number of years. In humans and other mammals this variation in aging shows up in chemical modifications known as DNA methylation marks. Some researchers call these marks 'epigenetic', which literally means 'upon the genes'. And some DNA methylation marks change with age, so their combined pattern of change is often called the `epigenetic clock'.             Environmental stressors, such as smoking or lack of physical activity, can make the epigenetic clock `tick' faster, making the DNA of some individuals appear older than expected based on their actual age in years. These `biologically older' individuals may also experience a higher risk of age-related disease. Studies in humans have revealed some of the reasons behind this fast biological aging, but it is unclear whether these results apply in the wild. It is possible that early life events trigger changes in the epigenetic clock, affecting health in adulthood. In primates, for example, adversity in early life has known effects on fertility and survival. Low social status also has a negative effect on health.             To find out whether early experiences and the social environment affect the epigenetic clock, Anderson, Johnston et al. tracked DNA methylation marks in baboons. This revealed that epigenetic clocks are strong predictors of age in wild primates, but neither early adversity nor the strength of social bonds affected the rate at which the clocks ticked. In fact, it was competition for social status that had the most dramatic effect on the clock's speed. Samples of males taken at different times during their lives showed that their epigenetic clocks sped up or slowed down as they moved up or down the social ladder, reflecting recent social experiences, rather than events early in their lives. On average, epigenetic clock measurements overestimated the age in years of alpha males by almost a year, showing that fighting to be on top comes at a cost.             This study highlights one way in which the social environment can influence aging. The next step is to understand how health is affected by the ways that animals attain social status. This could help researchers who study evolution understand how social interactions and environmental conditions affect survival and reproduction. It could also provide insight into the effects of social status on human health and aging.},

Despite extensive studies of enhancers, we still have a very limited understanding of their mechanisms of action and their restricted spatio-temporal activities. A better understanding would ultimately lead to fundamental insights into the control of gene transcription and the action of regulatory genetic variants involved in disease. Here, I review and discuss pros and cons of state-of-the-art genomics methods to localize and infer the activity of enhancers. Among the different approaches, profiling of enhancer RNAs yields the highest specificity and may be superior in detecting in vivo activity. I discuss their apparent similarities to promoters, which challenge the established view of enhancers and promoters as distinct entities, and present a unifying model of regulatory elements in transcriptional regulation, in which activity, transcriptional output and regulatory function is context specific.},

Epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation may contribute to environmentally induced phenotypic variation by modifying gene expression. Changes in DNA methylation, unlike DNA mutations, can be influenced by the environment; they are stable at the time scale of an individual and present different levels of heritability. These characteristics make DNA methylation a potentially important molecular process to respond to environmental change. The aim of this review is to present the implications of DNA methylation on phenotypic variations driven by environmental changes. More specifically, we explore epigenetic concepts concerning phenotypic change in response to the environment and heritability of DNA methylation, namely the Baldwin effect and genetic accommodation. Before addressing this point, we report major differences in DNA methylation across taxa and the role of this modification in producing and maintaining environmentally induced phenotypic variation. We also present the different methods allowing the detection of methylation polymorphism. We believe this review will be helpful to molecular ecologists, in that it highlights the importance of epigenetic processes in ecological and evolutionary studies.},

  abstract = {Across the Global South, wildlife is an important source of nutrition and income, particularly for rural communities. While wildlife consumption provides a valuable source of nutrition, high levels of hunting can endanger wildlife species. In the Makira region of north-eastern Madagascar, human health is threatened by food insecurity and malnutrition, and spiny tenrecs are a crucial source of subsistence bushmeat with 91\% of households consuming tenrecs at least once per year. Moreover, Makira's human populations are increasing, resulting in forest decline and degradation. In order to inform conservation and public health efforts, we investigated the influence of hunting, habitat loss and forest degradation on spiny tenrec population dynamics in the Makira region. We collected data on tenrec population densities as well as hunting and consumption by humans in 51 communities. We used these data to conduct a population viability analysis for the two most commonly hunted spiny tenrecs (Tenrec ecaudatus and Setifer setosus). We found that current harvest rates for these species are generally sustainable in the Makira region, largely due to tenrecs' extraordinary fecundity. However, even assuming no change in current hunting rates, tenrec populations could become threatened if fecundity were to decline or background mortality to increase, both possible scenarios under future trajectories of habitat loss and degradation. We find that any future increase in hunting-induced mortality rates for tenrecs are similarly unsustainable -- and likely to occur as human populations expand and hunting areas decline. We conclude that there is a vanishing window of opportunity to sustainably manage tenrec hunting in northeastern Madagascar in order to avoid negative conservation and human health outcomes.},

Growth and welfare of reared organisms are affected by physical, chemical, and biological parameters.

Relationship between fish density and oxygen's optimum levels is essential for designing the performance of each species. Furthermore, it is also necessary to study fish stress factors and physiological responses. Two rearing experiments with gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) were performed, in order to test different densities (5, 10 and 20 kg/m3) for 9 weeks (271 {\textpm} 1.9 g) and to test different levels of oxygen (40\%--60\%, 60\%--80\%, and 80\%--100\%) for 6 weeks (316.3 {\textpm} 1.73 g). In both experiments, physiology and growth parameters were analysed, as well as water quality. This study showed that no relation was observed between density and fish physiology, but there structural (gill lesions) and physiological changes (haematocrit) were observed for seabream reared at low levels of DO.},

Two broad types of workers exist in eusocial bees: nurses who care for their young siblings and the queen, and foragers who guard the nest and forage for food. Comparisons between these two worker subcastes have been performed in honeybees, but data from other bees are scarce. To understand whether similar molecular mechanisms are involved in nurse-forager differences across distinct species, we compared gene expression and DNA methylation profiles between nurses and foragers of the buff-tailed bumblebee               Bombus terrestris               and the stingless bee               Tetragonisca angustula.               These datasets were then compared to previous findings from honeybees. Our analyses revealed that although the expression pattern of genes is often species-specific, many of the biological processes and molecular pathways involved are common. Moreover, the correlation between gene expression and DNA methylation was dependent on the nucleotide context, and non-CG methylation appeared to be a relevant factor in the behavioral changes of the workers. In summary, task specialization in worker bees is characterized by a plastic and mosaic molecular pattern, with species-specific mechanisms acting upon broad common pathways across species.},

  abstract = {Epigenetics is the study of changes in gene activity that can be transmitted through cell divisions but cannot be explained by changes in the DNA sequence. Epigenetic mechanisms are central to gene regulation, phenotypic plasticity, development and the preservation of genome integrity. Epigenetic mechanisms are often held to make a minor contribution to evolutionary change because epigenetic states are typically erased and reset at every generation, and are therefore, not heritable. Nonetheless, there is growing appreciation that epigenetic variation makes direct and indirect contributions to evolutionary processes. First, some epigenetic states are transmitted intergenerationally and affect the phenotype of offspring. Moreover,               bona fide               heritable `epialleles' exist and are quite common in plants. Such epialleles could, therefore, be subject to natural selection in the same way as conventional DNA sequence-based alleles. Second, epigenetic variation enhances phenotypic plasticity and phenotypic variance and thus can modulate the effect of natural selection on sequence-based genetic variation. Third, given that phenotypic plasticity is central to the adaptability of organisms, epigenetic mechanisms that generate plasticity and acclimation are important to consider in evolutionary theory. Fourth, some genes are under selection to be `imprinted' identifying the sex of the parent from which they were derived, leading to parent-of-origin-dependent gene expression and effects. These effects can generate hybrid disfunction and contribute to speciation. Finally, epigenetic processes, particularly DNA methylation, contribute directly to DNA sequence evolution, because they act as mutagens on the one hand and modulate genome stability on the other by keeping transposable elements in check.

  abstract = {With the continued growth of the aquaculture industry and increasing scientific discussion over the potential for negative events to give rise to suffering, research into the welfare of cultured fish is vital. How we define and measure welfare is cause for debate, particularly in fish. However, research into the effects of aquaculture procedures on welfare is crucial to produce data and recommendations for best practice and future legislation. Both behavioural and physiological measures of welfare are necessary for correct interpretation and while there is a wealth of knowledge on the physiological consequences of many aquaculture practices it is now equally important for us to understand the behavioural responses to these practices and to relate them to fish welfare. Here I review the scientific data that allows us to interpret the effects of disease, handling, transport, food deprivation, and slaughter technique on fish welfare. The effects of stocking density, also an area of welfare concern, are complex and appear to comprise of numerous interacting and case specific factors. Investigation into the relative importance of these factors, particularly through behavioural studies, will serve to improve welfare. Stocking density, diet, feeding technique, and management procedures all have strong effects on stress responses, subsequent stress tolerance, health, and the occurrence of aggressive behaviour. Strategies to reduce disease susceptibility, minimise stress responses, and avoid aggression are, therefore, vital. However, caution should be taken when interpreting ``abnormal'' fish behaviour and further research is required to allow us to establish the importance of the expression of ``natural'' behaviours. Collectively this growing area of research serves to improve our knowledge of the impacts of aquaculture and intensive farming procedures on fish welfare and is the first step in improving welfare wherever possible.},

Snapper (Chrysophrys auratus) has been identified as a promising candidate for aquaculture development and an initial population has been established at the New Zealand Institute for Plant \& Food Research Limited. The aim of the present study was to combine high-throughput Genotyping by Sequencing (GBS) and trait data from this population to reconstruct the pedigree, measure the degree of inbreeding across generations, and determine the heritability of 11 traits of interest within the breeding programme, in particular growth-related traits. Likelihood of parentage values showed that the pedigree consisted of a complex mixture of full- and half-sib individuals, with skewed contributions across parents. Average inbreeding did not change significantly between generations, but dramatic inbreeding differences were detected between F2 descendants from the two independent starting (F0) cohorts and between F2 offspring from either full-sib, half-sib, or unrelated F1 parents. Trait heritability ranged from 0.03 to 0.63, with growth related traits being situated around 0.27 and 0.10 in the first and third year, respectively. These results suggest that selection for higher growth could result in 4.6--15.7\% and 1.4--4.9\% improvement per generation, in the first and third years, respectively.},

Evolutionarily conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) in the human genome have attracted considerable attention for their potential to simplify the search for functional elements and phenotypically important human alleles. A major outstanding question is whether functionally significant human noncoding variation is concentrated in CNSs or distributed more broadly across the genome. Here, we combine wholegenome sequence data from four nonhuman species (chimp, dog, mouse, and rat) with recently available comprehensive human polymorphism data to analyze selection at single-nucleotide resolution. We show that a substantial fraction of active purifying selection in human noncoding sequences occurs outside of CNSs and is diffusely distributed across the genome. This finding suggests the existence of a large complement of human noncoding variants that may impact gene expression and phenotypic traits, the majority of which will escape detection with current approaches to genome analysis.},

Because low-frequency and rare variants are not tagged by conventional genome-wide genotyping arrays, they may represent an important and understudied component of complex trait genetics. In contrast to common variant GWASs, there are many different types of study designs, assays and analytic techniques that can be utilized for rare variant association studies (RVASs). In this review, we briefly present the different technologies available to identify rare genetic variants, including novel exome arrays. We also compare the different study designs for RVASs and argue that the best design will likely be phenotype-dependent. We discuss the main analytical issues relevant to RVASs, including the different statistical methods that can be used to test genetic associations with rare variants and the various bioinformatic approaches to predicting in silico biological functions for variants. Finally, we describe recent rare variant association findings, highlighting the unexpected conclusion that most rare variants have modest-to-small effect sizes on phenotypic variation. This observation has major implications for our understanding of the genetic architecture of complex traits in the context of the unexplained heritability challenge.},

To understand the effects of inbreeding in natural populations where environmental conditions are variable, we need to examine not only how the effects of inbreeding change among environments but also how inbreeding may affect the ability to respond to environmental conditions (i.e. phenotypic plasticity). We reared selfed and outcrossed hermaphroditic snails (               Physa acuta               ) in the presence and absence of chemical cues from predatory crayfish and quantified expression of an inducible defence, an adaptively plastic response to predation risk. Overall, inbred snails exhibited reduced defences, but more importantly, inbreeding reduced the expression of predator-induced adaptive plasticity. Inbreeding depression in defensive morphology was 26 per cent and inbreeding depression in the plasticity of this trait was 48 per cent. Inbreeding depression in adaptive plasticity may be important to understanding the effects of inbreeding in nature.},

  abstract = {The complex and rapid environmental changes brought about by urbanization pose significant challenges to organisms. The multifaceted effects of urbanization often make it difficult to define and pinpoint the very nature of adaptive urban phenotypes. In such situations, scanning genomes for regions differentiated between urban and non-urban populations may be an attractive approach. Here, we investigated the genomic signatures of adaptation to urbanization in the damselfly Ischnura elegans sampled from 31 rural and urban localities in three geographic regions: southern and northern Poland, and southern Sweden. Genome-wide variation was assessed using more than 370,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped by ddRADseq. Associations between SNPs and the level of urbanization were tested using two genetic environment association methods: Latent Factors Mixed Models and BayPass. While we found numerous candidate SNPs and a highly significant overlap between candidates identified by the two methods within the geographic regions, there was a distinctive lack of repeatability between the geographic regions both at the level of individual SNPs and of genomic regions. However, we found ``synapse organization'' at the top of the functional categories enriched among the genes located in the proximity of the candidate urbanization SNPs. Interestingly, the overall significance of ``syn apse organization'' was built up by the accretion of different genes associated with candidate SNPs in different geographic regions. This finding is consistent with the highly polygenic nature of adaptation, where the response may be achieved through a subtle adjustment of allele frequencies in different genes that contribute to adaptive phenotypes. Taken together, our results point to a polygenic adaptive response in the nervous system, specifically implicating genes involved in synapse organization, which mirrors the findings from several genomic and behavioral studies of adaptation to urbanization in other taxa.},

However, there is limited knowledge about the factors governing recombination rate variation. We genotyped 1920 single nucleotide polymorphisms in a multigeneration pedigree of more than 1000 zebra finches (               Taeniopygia guttata               ) to develop a genetic linkage map, and then we used these map data together with the recently available draft genome sequence of the zebra finch to estimate recombination rates in 1 Mb intervals across the genome. The average zebra finch recombination rate (1.5 cM/Mb) is higher than in humans, but significantly lower than in chicken. The local rates of recombination in chicken and zebra finch were only weakly correlated, demonstrating evolutionary turnover of the recombination landscape in birds. The distribution of recombination events was heavily biased toward ends of chromosomes, with a stronger telomere effect than so far seen in any organism. In fact, the recombination rate was as low as 0.1 cM/Mb in intervals up to 100 Mb long in the middle of the larger chromosomes. We found a positive correlation between recombination rate and GC content, as well as GC-rich sequence motifs. Levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) were significantly higher in regions of low recombination, showing that heterogeneity in recombination rates have left a footprint on the genomic landscape of LD in zebra finch populations.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Dominance is a form of phenotypic robustness to mutations. Understanding how such robustness can evolve provides a window into how the relation between genotype and phenotype can evolve. As such, the issue of dominance evolution is a question about the evolution of inheritance systems. Attempts at explaining the evolution of dominance have run into two problems. One is that selection for dominance is sensitive to the frequency of heterozygotes. Accordingly, dominance cannot evolve unless special conditions lead to the presence of a high frequency of mutant alleles in the population. Second, on the basis of theoretical results in metabolic control analysis, it has been proposed that metabolic systems possess inherent constraints. These hypothetical constraints imply the default manifestation of dominance of the wild type with respect to the effects of mutations at most loci. Hence, some biologists have maintained that an evolutionary explanation is not relevant to dominance. In this article, we put into question the hypothetical assumption of default metabolic constraints. We show that this assumption is based on an exclusion of important nonlinear interactions that can occur between enzymes in a pathway. With an a priori exclusion of such interactions, the possibility of epistasis and hence dominance modification is eliminated. We present a theoretical model that integrates enzyme kinetics and population genetics to address dominance evolution in metabolic pathways. In the case of mutations that decrease enzyme concentrations, and given the mechanistic constraints of Michaelis-Menten-type catalysis, it is shown that dominance of the wild type can be extensively modified in a two-enzyme pathway. Moreover, we discuss analytical results indicating that the conclusions from the two-enzyme case can be generalized to any number of enzymes. Dominance modification is achieved chiefly through changes in enzyme concentrations or kinetic parameters such as kcat, both of which can alter saturation levels. Low saturation translates into higher levels of dominance with respect to mutations that decrease enzyme concentrations. Furthermore, it is shown that in the two-enzyme example, dominance evolves as a by-product of selection in a manner that is insensitive to the frequency of heterozygotes. Using variation in kcat as an example of modifier mutations, it is shown that the latter can have direct fitness effects in addition to dominance modification effects. Dominance evolution can occur in a frequency-insensitive manner as a result of selection for such dual-effects alleles. This type of selection may prove to be a common pattern for the evolution of phenotypic robustness to mutations.},

Studies suggest that male voices dominate introductory biology courses, but no studies have been done on upper-level courses. Results on achievement gender gaps in biology vary and often conflict, and no studies have been done on the correlation between participation and academic performance gaps. We observed 34 life sciences courses at all levels at a large private university. Overall, males were more likely to participate than their female peers, but these gender gaps varied from class to class. Females participated more in classes in which the instructor called on most hands that were raised or in classes with more females in attendance. Performance gender gaps also varied by classroom, but female final course grades were as much as 0.2 SD higher in classes with a female instructor and/or a female student majority. Gender gaps in participation and final course grades were positively correlated, but this could be solely because female students are more likely to both participate more and earn higher grades in classes with many females in attendance.},

While associating genotype with phenotype often utilizes standard trait morphology, trait representations in morphospace using geometric morphometric approaches receive less focus in this regard. Here, we identify genetic associations to a sexual ornament, the comb, in the chicken system (Gallus gallus). Our approach combined genome-wide genotype and gene expression data ({$>$}30k genes) with different aspects of comb morphology in an advanced intercross line (F8) generated by crossing a wild-type Red Junglefowl with a domestic breed of chicken (White Leghorn). In total, 10 quantitative trait loci were found associated to various aspects of comb shape and size, while 1,184 expression QTL were found associated to gene expression patterns, among which 98 had overlapping confidence intervals with those of quantitative trait loci. Our results highlight both known genomic regions confirming previous records of a large effect quantitative trait loci associated to comb size, and novel quantitative trait loci associated to comb shape. Genes were considered candidates affecting comb morphology if they were found within both confidence intervals of the underlying quantitative trait loci and eQTL. Overlaps between quantitative trait loci and genome-wide selective sweeps identified in a previous study revealed that only loci associated to comb size may be experiencing on-going selection under domestication.},

When tested on the human genome, our approach was able to properly identify and group known transposable elements.

  abstract = {In lek mating systems, females choose mates through indicators of quality, which males may exhibit by their performance of courtship displays. In temperate regions, displaying seasons are brief (one to two months), whereas in the tropics courtship seasons may be prolonged. Moreover, in temperate-breeding animals lekking behaviour can be energetically demanding, but little is known about the energy costs of lekking in tropical animals. Daily, over the course of a nearly seven-month-long breeding season, male golden-collared manakins (               Manacus vitellinus               ) of Panamanian rainforests perform acrobatic courtship displays that markedly elevate heart rates, suggesting that they require high energy investment. Typically, animals of tropical lowland forests (such as manakins) exhibit a `slow pace of life' metabolic strategy. We investigated whether male manakin courtship is indeed metabolically costly or whether the birds retain a low daily energy expenditure (DEE), as seen in other tropical species. To assess these questions, we calibrated manakin heart rate against metabolic rate, examined daily lek activity and, using telemetry, obtained heart rates of individual wild, lekking male manakins. Although metabolic rates peak during courtship displays, we found that males actually invest minimal time (only approx. 5 min d               -1               ) performing displays. As a consequence, the DEE of approximately 39 kJ d               -1               for male manakins is comparable to other lowland tropical species. The short, intense bursts of courtship by these birds make up only approximately 1.2\% of their total DEE. Presumably, this cost is negligible, enabling them to perform daily at their arenas for months on end.},

Analysis shows how the inbreeding depression decreases as population size becomes smaller and{\textbackslash}or the rate of inbreeding increases. This pattern contrasts with that for the load, which increases as population size becomes smaller but decreases as inbreeding rate goes up. The depression and load both approach asymptotic limits when the population size becomes very large or very small. Numerical results show that the transition between the small and the large population regimes is quite rapid, and occurs largely over a range of population sizes that vary by a factor of 10. The effects of drift on inbreeding depression may bias some estimates of the genomic rate of deleterious mutation. These effects could also be important in the evolution of breeding systems in hermaphroditic organisms and in the conservation of endangered populations.},

This study explored whether eye white and ear posture can reliably contribute to interpret valence and arousal of emotions in dairy cows. The research was conducted in five Italian dairy farms. Four hundred and thirty-six photographs of cows' heads were scored (four-level), according to the eye white and ear posture during feeding, resting, pasture, and an avoidance distance test at the feeding rack (ADF test). Eye white and ear posture were significantly correlated and influenced by the context (P = 0.001). Pasture was the most relaxing context for cows (67.8\% of half-closed eyes; 77.3\% ears hung down or backwards). The excitement during ADF test was high, with 44.8\% of eye white being clearly visible and ears directed forwards to the approaching assessor (95.5\%). Housing and management mostly influenced emotions during feeding and resting (P = 0.002 and P = 0.001, respectively): where competition for feeding places and cubicles was low, the cows showed the highest percentages of half-closed eyes and ears backwards or hung down. This research supports the use of eye white and ear posture as reliable indicators of emotions in dairy cows.},

To decipher this genomic regulatory code, and to investigate the developmental relevance of noncoding transcription, we compared genome-wide promoter activity throughout embryogenesis in 5 Drosophila species. Core promoters, generally not thought to play a significant regulatory role, in fact impart restrictions on the developmental timing of gene expression on a global scale. We propose a hierarchical regulatory model in which core promoters define broad windows of opportunity for expression, by defining a range of transcription factors from which they can receive regulatory inputs. This two-tiered mechanism globally orchestrates developmental gene expression, including extremely widespread noncoding transcription. The sequence and expression specificity of noncoding RNA promoters are evolutionarily conserved, implying biological relevance. Overall, this work introduces a hierarchical model for developmental gene regulation, and reveals a major role for noncoding transcription in animal development.},

  abstract = {Telomeres are protective DNA--protein complexes located at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, whose length has been shown to predict life-history parameters in various species. Although this suggests that telomere length is subject to natural selection, its evolutionary dynamics crucially depends on its heritability. Using pedigree data for a population of white-throated dippers (               Cinclus cinclus               ), we test whether and how variation in early-life relative telomere length (RTL, measured as the number of telomeric repeats relative to a control gene using qPCR) is transmitted across generations. We disentangle the relative effects of genes and environment and test for sex-specific patterns of inheritance. There was strong and significant resemblance among offspring sharing the same nest and offspring of the same cohort. Furthermore, although offspring resemble their mother, and there is some indication for an effect of inbreeding, additive genetic variance and heritability are close to zero. We find no evidence for a role of either maternal imprinting or Z-linked inheritance in generating these patterns, suggesting they are due to non-genetic maternal and common environment effects instead. We conclude that in this wild bird population, environmental factors are the main drivers of variation in early-life RTL, which will severely bias estimates of heritability when not modelled explicitly.},

Multivariate analysis was used to test for seasonal, sex- or location-related differences in the diet. Results Plant fragments accounted for 98\% of the diet and included 53 plant species or taxa. Invertebrates made up the remaining 2\%. Diet varied significantly between seasons and sexes. Both sexes ate more ericaceous shrubs in autumn and winter, with females eating more than males. The plant parts eaten varied seasonally. In summer, fruits, flowers and seeds were favoured over leaves, which dominated in winter. Conclusions With few trees, birds were reliant upon Heather in autumn and winter. Black Grouse Tetrao tetrix were once common throughout most of Britain, but during the last century have declined rapidly due to changes in land use and overgrazing, causing widespread loss and deterioration in the quality of their habitat (Baines \& Hudson 1995, Hancock et al. 1999). The Black Grouse population in England is now restricted to the north, where 90\% occur within the moorland fringe habitats of the North Pennines (Warren \& Baines 2004). Here they are found where heather moor, blanket bog and rough grassland (dominated by grasses, rushes and sedges) meet enclosed hay meadows, pastures and semiimproved fields (Baines 1994, Warren \& Baines 2002). Importantly, these habitats are largely devoid of trees and hence differ from more typical boreal forest habitats occupied by Black Grouse in Scandinavia (Swenson \& Angelstam 1993) or montane pastures and woodlands in the Alps of central Europe (BernardLaurent 1984, Marti 1985).},

  abstract = {Quantifying hunting-induced defaunation                            As the human population grows and increasingly encroaches on remaining wildlife habitat, hunting threatens many species. Ben{\'i}tez-L{\'o}pez               et al.               conducted a large-scale meta-analysis of hunting trends and impacts across the tropics (see the Perspective by Brashares and Gaynor). Bird and mammal populations were considerably lower in areas where hunting occurred. Although commercial hunting and proximity to roads and urban centers were the most damaging factors, all hunting had worrying impacts, even in protected areas. Protection and alternative approaches for sustainable subsistence hunting must be implemented soon if we are to prevent further, rapid defaunation.                                         Science               , this issue p.               180               ; see also p.               136                        ,              Hunting of wildlife significantly affects mammal and bird populations across the tropics.           ,              Hunting is a major driver of biodiversity loss, but a systematic large-scale estimate of hunting-induced defaunation is lacking. We synthesized 176 studies to quantify hunting-induced declines of mammal and bird populations across the tropics. Bird and mammal abundances declined by 58\% (25 to 76\%) and by 83\% (72 to 90\%) in hunted compared with unhunted areas. Bird and mammal populations were depleted within 7 and 40 kilometers from hunters' access points (roads and settlements). Additionally, hunting pressure was higher in areas with better accessibility to major towns where wild meat could be traded. Mammal population densities were lower outside protected areas, particularly because of commercial hunting. Strategies to sustainably manage wild meat hunting in both protected and unprotected tropical ecosystems are urgently needed to avoid further defaunation.},

Through sensors (cameras, microphones and accelerometers), images, sounds and movements are combined with algorithms to non-invasively monitor animals to detect their welfare and predict productivity. In turn, this remote monitoring of livestock can provide quantitative and early alerts to situations of poor welfare requiring the stockperson's attention. While swine practitioners' skills include translation of pig data entry into pig health and well-being indices, many do not yet have enough familiarity to advise their clients on the adoption of precision livestock farming practices. This review, intended for swine veterinarians and specialists, (1) includes an introduction to algorithms and machine learning, (2) summarizes current literature on relevant sensors and sensor network systems, and drawing from industry pig welfare audit criteria, (3) explains how these applications can be used to improve swine welfare and meet current pork production stakeholder expectations. Swine practitioners, by virtue of their animal and client advocacy roles, interpretation of benchmarking data, and stewardship in regulatory and traceability programs, can play a broader role as advisors in the transfer of precision livestock farming technology, and its implications to their clients.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Inversions are structural mutations that reverse the sequence of a chromosome segment and reduce the effective rate of recombination in the heterozygous state. They play a major role in adaptation, as well as in other evolutionary processes such as speciation. Although inversions have been studied since the 1920s, they remain difficult to investigate because the reduced recombination conferred by them strengthens the effects of drift and hitchhiking, which in turn can obscure signatures of selection. Nonetheless, numerous inversions have been found to be under selection. Given recent advances in population genetic theory and empirical study, here we review how different mechanisms of selection affect the evolution of inversions. A key difference between inversions and other mutations, such as single nucleotide variants, is that the fitness of an inversion may be affected by a larger number of frequently interacting processes. This considerably complicates the analysis of the causes underlying the evolution of inversions. We discuss the extent to which these mechanisms can be disentangled, and by which approach.},

  abstract = {There is ample evidence for inbreeding depression manifested as a reduction in fitness or fitness-related traits in the focal individual. In many organisms, fitness is not only affected by genes carried by the individual, but also by genes carried by their parents, for example if receiving parental care. While maternal effects have been described in many systems, the extent to which inbreeding affects fitness directly through the focal individual, or indirectly through the inbreeding coefficients of its parents, has rarely been examined jointly. The Soay sheep study population is an excellent system in which to test for both effects, as lambs receive extended maternal care. Here, we tested for both maternal and individual inbreeding depression in three fitness-related traits (birthweight and weight and hindleg length at 4 months of age) and three fitness components (first-year survival, adult annual survival and annual breeding success), using either pedigree-derived inbreeding or genomic estimators calculated using {\textasciitilde}37 000 SNP markers. We found evidence for inbreeding depression in 4-month hindleg and weight, first-year survival in males, and annual survival and breeding success in adults. Maternal inbreeding was found to depress both birthweight and 4-month weight. We detected more instances of significant inbreeding depression using genomic estimators than the pedigree, which is partly explained through the increased sample sizes available. In conclusion, our results highlight that cross-generational inbreeding effects warrant further exploration in species with parental care and that modern genomic tools can be used successfully instead of, or alongside, pedigrees in natural populations.},

It is therefore crucial to understand the important population parameters that affect inbreeding, particularly in reintroduction programs. Using data from 41 reintroduced Alpine ibex (Capra ibex ibex) populations we estimated inbreeding since the beginning of reintroductions using population-specific Fst, and inbreeding over the last few generations with contemporary effective population sizes. Total levels of inbreeding since reintroduction of ibex were, on average, close to that from one generation of half-sib mating. Contemporary effective population sizes did not reflect total inbreeding since reintroduction, but 16\% of variation in contemporary effective population sizes among populations was due to variation in current population sizes. Substantial variation in inbreeding levels among populations was explained by founder group sizes and the harmonic mean population sizes since founding. This study emphasizes that, in addition to founder group sizes, early population growth rates are important parameters determining inbreeding levels in reintroduced populations.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             Dominance is a basic property of inheritance systems describing the link between a diploid genotype at a single locus and the resulting phenotype. Models for the evolution of dominance have long been framed as an opposition between the irreconcilable views of Fisher in 1928 supporting the role of largely elusive dominance modifiers and Wright in 1929, who viewed dominance as an emerging property of the structure of enzymatic pathways. Recent theoretical and empirical advances however suggest that these opposing views can be reconciled, notably using models investigating the regulation of gene expression and developmental processes. In this more comprehensive framework, phenotypic dominance emerges from departures from linearity between any levels of integration in the genotype-to-phenotype map. Here, we review how these different models illuminate the emergence and evolution of dominance. We then detail recent empirical studies shedding new light on the diversity of molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying dominance and its evolution. By reconciling population genetics and functional biology, we hope our review will facilitate cross-talk among research fields in the integrative study of dominance evolution.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             Reproduction is expected to carry an oxidative cost, yet in many species breeders appear to sustain lower levels of oxidative damage compared to non-breeders. This paradox may be explained by considering the intergenerational costs of reproduction. Specifically, a reduction in oxidative damage upon transitioning to a reproductive state may represent a pre-emptive shielding strategy to protect the next generation from intergenerational oxidative damage (IOD) -- known as the oxidative shielding hypothesis. Males may be particularly likely to transmit IOD, because sperm are highly susceptible to oxidative damage. Yet, the possibility of male-mediated IOD remains largely uninvestigated. Here, we present a conceptual and methodological framework to assess intergenerational costs of reproduction and oxidative shielding of the germline in males. We discuss variance in reproductive costs and expected payoffs of oxidative shielding according to species' life histories, and the expected impact on offspring fitness. Oxidative shielding presents an opportunity to incorporate intergenerational effects into the advancing field of life-history evolution.},

  abstract = {The lek paradox, in which female choice erodes genetic variation in male sexually selected traits, is a fundamental issue in sexual selection. If females gain only genetic benefits from preferentially having their ova fertilized by males with particular traits, what maintains variation in these traits? Under strong directional selection mediated through mate choice, the alleles for beneficial male traits are expected to go to fixation and exhibit little variation. A theoretical solution to the lek paradox is the genic capture hypothesis which states that: costly male traits subject to female choice are condition dependent, that male condition is dependent on genes at many loci and exhibits additive genetic variance, and that positive genetic correlations exist between sexually selected traits and condition. Using a captive population of the zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata, we tested two key predictions from this model: (1) that genetic variance exists in beak color which is a sexually selected trait, but also in condition and immune function, and (2) that positive genetic correlations exist between condition and beak color, and between beak color, condition, and immune function. Genetic parameters were estimated from a large breeding experiment involving 81 sires, 972 offspring, a pedigree of 1526 individuals, using the animal model. We employed the following index of body condition: residuals from a log-log plot of body mass on tarsus length following a standardized and extended period of exercise, in which residual mass is known to reflect fat and protein reserves. Our results were broadly consistent with the genic capture hypothesis because we found (1) additive genetic variation in beak color and immune function and condition, and (2) positive genetic correlations between condition and beak color, and between condition, beak color, and several assays of immune responsiveness. However, both of these results need qualification. In the first case we identified an important general problem in estimating the coefficient of additive genetic variance (CVA) in body condition. In the second case, although most of the genetic correlations were positive as predicted, only some were statistically significant, possibly due to our relatively small sample sizes, because genetic correlations typically have large standard errors and therefore require very large samples to be statistically significant. The statistically significant, positive genetic correlations included those between beak color and immune function (response to tetanus), and between immune function (response to tetanus) and condition, both of which indicate that females gain good genes from mating with males in good condition and/or with a redder beak color. We discuss the implications of our results for devising more rigorous but pragmatic tests of the genic capture hypothesis.},

In Latin America including Venezuela, trypanosomosis of ruminants is mainly caused by               Trypanosoma vivax               . Biologically active substances produced from trypanosomes, as well as host-trypanosome cellular interactions, contribute to the pathogenesis of anemia in an infection. The aim of this study was to examine with a scanning electron microscope the cellular interactions and alterations in ovine red blood cells (RBC) experimentally infected with               T. vivax               . Ovine infection resulted in changes of RBC shape as well as the formation of surface holes or vesicles. A frequent observation was the adhesion to the ovine RBC by the trypanosome's free flagellum, cell body, or attached flagellum in a process mediated by the filopodia emission from the trypanosome surface. The observed RBC alterations are caused by mechanical and biochemical damage from host-parasite interactions occurring in the bloodstream. The altered erythrocytes are prone to mononuclear phagocytic removal contributing to the hematocrit decrease during infection.},

  abstract = {The distribution of fitness effects (DFE) for new mutations is fundamental for many aspects of population and quantitative genetics. In this study, we have inferred the DFE in the single-celled alga               Chlamydomonas reinhardtii               by estimating changes in the frequencies of 254 spontaneous mutations under experimental evolution and equating the frequency changes of linked mutations with their selection coefficients. We generated seven populations of recombinant haplotypes by crossing seven independently derived mutation accumulation lines carrying an average of 36 mutations in the haploid state to a mutation-free strain of the same genotype. We then allowed the populations to evolve under natural selection in the laboratory by serial transfer in liquid culture. We observed substantial and repeatable changes in the frequencies of many groups of linked mutations, and, surprisingly, as many mutations were observed to increase as decrease in frequency. Mutation frequencies were highly repeatable among replicates, suggesting that selection was the cause of the observed allele frequency changes. We developed a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain method to infer the DFE. This computes the likelihood of the observed distribution of changes of frequency, and obtains the posterior distribution of the selective effects of individual mutations, while assuming a two-sided gamma distribution of effects. We infer that the DFE is a highly leptokurtic distribution, and that approximately equal proportions of mutations have positive and negative effects on fitness. This result is consistent with what we have observed in previous work on a different               C               .               reinhardtii               strain, and suggests that a high fraction of new spontaneously arisen mutations are advantageous in a simple laboratory environment.},

Theory suggests that condition integrates genetic, epigenetic and somatic factors, and therefore predicts alignment between the phenotypic effects of genetic and environmental quality. To test this key prediction, we manipulated both genetic (mutational) and environmental (dietary) quality in Drosophila melanogaster and examined responses in morphological and chemical (cuticular hydrocarbon, CHC) traits in both sexes. While the phenotypic effects of diet were consistent among genotypes, effects of mutation load varied in magnitude and direction. Average effects of diet and mutation were aligned for most morphological traits, but non-aligned for the male sexcombs and CHCs in both sexes. Our results suggest the existence of distinct forms of condition dependence, one integrating both genetic and environmental effects and the other purely environmental. We propose a model to account for these observations.},

  abstract = {The hypothesis that sexual selection drives the evolution of condition dependence is not firmly supported by empirical evidence, and the process remains poorly understood. First, even though sexual competition typically involves multiple traits, studies usually compare a single sexual trait with a single ``control'' trait, ignoring variation among sexual traits and raising the possibility of sampling bias. Second, few studies have addressed the genetic basis of condition dependence. Third, even though condition dependence is thought to result from a form of sex-specific epistasis, the evolution of condition dependence has never been considered in relation to intralocus sexual conflict. We argue that condition dependence may weaken intersexual genetic correlations and facilitate the evolution of sexual dimorphism. To address these questions, we manipulated an environmental factor affecting condition (larval diet) and examined its effects on four sexual and four nonsexual traits in Prochyliza xanthostoma adults. As predicted by theory, the strength of condition dependence increased with degree of exaggeration among male traits. Body shape was more condition dependent in males than in females and, perhaps as a result, genetic and environmental effects on body shape were congruent in males, but not in females. However, of the four male sexual traits, only head length was significantly larger in high-condition males after controlling for body size. Strong condition dependence was associated with reduced intersexual genetic correlation. However, homologous male and female traits exhibited correlated responses to condition, suggesting an intersexual genetic correlation for condition dependence itself. Our findings support the role of sexual selection in the evolution of condition dependence, but reveal considerable variation in condition dependence among sexual traits. It is not clear whether the evolution of condition dependence has mitigated or exacerbated intralocus sexual conflict in this species.},

  abstract = {Precision livestock farming (PLF) is the management of livestock using the principles and technology of process engineering. Key to PLF is the dense monitoring of variegated parameters, including animal growth, output of produce (e.g. milk, eggs), diseases, animal behaviour, and the physical environment (e.g. thermal micro-environment, ammonia emissions). While its proponents consider PLF a win-win strategy that combines production efficiency with sustainability goals and animal welfare, critics emphasise, inter alia, the potential interruption of human-animal relationships. This paper discusses the notion that the objectification of animals by PLF influences the developmental pathways of conventional industrial farming. We conduct a conceptual analysis of objectification by comparing discussions in feminist ethics and animal ethics. We find that in animal ethics, objectification includes deontological arguments regarding instrumentalisation, de-animalisation, alienation, commodification and quantification of animals. The focus on socio-political context and relationality connects these debates to central ideas in care ethics. We adopt a care ethics perspective to assess the implications of the objectification of animals in livestock farming. The basic claim is that sensory knowledge symbolised by the farmers' unity of hand, head and heart would make it harder to objectify animals than abstract and instrumental reasoning where the pursuit of knowledge is intertwined with the pursuit of control, as in mainstream PLF. Despite of what can be considered as a good caring relationship between farmers and animals that is mediated by PLF, people involved in conventional industrial farming still seem to become further detached from farmers and animals, because the PLF system itself is objectifying. PLF redefines the notion of care, in terms of data transparency, standardisation of methods for analysis, real-time collection and processing of data, remote control, and the use of digital platforms. This creates new expectations and requires a redistribution of responsibilities within a wider scope of relations in the value chain.},

  abstract = {Heritable phenotypic variation in plants can be caused not only by underlying genetic differences, but also by variation in epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation. However, we still know very little about how relevant such epigenetic variation is to the ecology and evolution of natural populations. We conducted a greenhouse experiment in which we treated a set of natural genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana with the demethylating agent 5-azacytidine and examined the consequences of this treatment for plant traits and their phenotypic plasticity. Experimental demethylation strongly reduced the growth and fitness of plants and delayed their flowering, but the degree of this response varied significantly among genotypes. Differences in genotypes' responses to demethylation were only weakly related to their genetic relatedness, which is consistent with the idea that natural epigenetic variation is independent of genetic variation. Demethylation also altered patterns of phenotypic plasticity, as well as the amount of phenotypic variation observed among plant individuals and genotype means. We have demonstrated that epigenetic variation can have a dramatic impact on ecologically important plant traits and their variability, as well as on the fitness of plants and their ecological interactions. Epigenetic variation may thus be an overlooked factor in the evolutionary ecology of plant populations.},

  abstract = {Massive defaunation and high extinction rates have become characteristic of the Anthropocene. Genetic effects of population decline can lead populations into an extinction vortex, where declining populations show lower genetic fitness, in turn leading to lower populations still. The lower genetic fitness in a declining population due to a shrinking gene pool is known as genetic erosion. Three different types of genetic erosion are highlighted in this review: overall homozygosity, genetic load and runs of homozygosity (ROH), which are indicative of inbreeding. The ability to quantify genetic erosion could be a very helpful tool for conservationists, as it can provide them with an objective, quantifiable measure to use in the assessment of species at risk of extinction. The link between conservation status and genetic erosion should become more apparent. Currently, no clear correlation can be observed between the current conservation status and genetic erosion. However, the high quantities of genetic erosion in wild populations, especially in those species dealing with habitat fragmentation and habitat decline, may be early signs of deteriorating populations. Whole genome sequencing data is the way forward to quantify genetic erosion. Extra screening steps for genetic load and hybridization can be included, since they could potentially have great impact on population fitness. This way, the information yielded from genetic sequence data can provide conservationists with an objective genetic method in the assessment of species at risk of extinction. However, the great complexity of genome erosion quantification asks for consensus and bridging science and its applications, which remains challenging.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Anthropogenic impact is causing the decline of a large proportion of species worldwide and reduces their genetic diversity. Island species typically have smaller ranges than continental species. As a consequence, island species are particularly liable to undergo population bottlenecks, giving rise to conservation challenges such as inbreeding and unmasking of deleterious genetic load. Such challenges call for more detailed assessments of the genetic make-up of threatened island populations. The Mascarene islands (Indian Ocean) present many prime examples, being unusual in having been pristine until first human arrival {\textasciitilde}400\,years ago, following which anthropogenic pressure was unusually intense. A threatened harrier (               Circus maillardi               ) endemic to the westernmost island of the archipelago is a good example of the challenges faced by species that have declined to small population size following intense anthropogenic pressure. In this study, we use an extensive set of population genomic tools to quantify variation at near-neutral and coding loci, in order to test the historical impact of human activity on this species, and evaluate the species' (mal)adaptive potential. We observed low but significant genetic differentiation between populations on the West and North-East sides of the island, echoing observations in other endemic species. Inbreeding was significant, with a substantial fraction of samples being first or second-degree relatives. Historical effective population sizes have declined from {\textasciitilde}3000 to 300 individuals in the past 1000\,years, with a more recent drop {\textasciitilde}100\,years ago consistent with human activity. Based on our simulations and comparisons with a close relative (               Circus melanoleucos               ), this demographic history may have allowed purging of the most deleterious variants but is unlikely to have allowed the purging of mildly deleterious variants. Our study shows how using relatively affordable methods can reveal the massive impact that human activity may have on the genetic diversity and adaptive potential of island populations, and calls for urgent action to closely monitor the reproductive success of such endemic populations, in association with genetic studies.},

Public health's commitment to social justice makes it a natural fit with intersectionality's focus on multiple historically oppressed populations. Yet despite a plethora of research focused on these populations, public health studies that reflect intersectionality in their theoretical frameworks, designs, analyses, or interpretations are rare. Accordingly, I describe the history and central tenets of intersectionality, address some theoretical and methodological challenges, and highlight the benefits of intersectionality for public health theory, research, and policy.},

The annual increase in pup production from 1976/77to 1990/91has declined to 9.8\% since the initial period of population expansion in the 1950sand 1960s.

Moreover, when emotions are transmitted from one individual to the next, leading to state matching (emotional contagion), information transfer and coordination between group members are facilitated. Despite the high potential for vocalizations to influence the affective state of surrounding individuals, vocal contagion of emotions has been largely unexplored in non-human animals. In this paper, I review the evidence for discrimination of vocal expression of emotions, which is a necessary step for emotional contagion to occur. I then describe possible proximate mechanisms underlying vocal contagion of emotions, propose criteria to assess this phenomenon and review the existing evidence. The literature so far shows that non-human animals are able to discriminate and be affected by conspecific and also potentially heterospecific (e.g. human) vocal expression of emotions. Since humans heavily rely on vocalizations to communicate (speech), I suggest that studying vocal contagion of emotions in non-human animals can lead to a better understanding of the evolution of emotional contagion and empathy.},

The exploration of such relationships first requires the identification of associations between molecular markers and phenotypes. Here, we explore the use of Random Forest (RF), a powerful machine-learning algorithm, in genomic studies to discern loci underlying both discrete and quantitative traits, particularly when studying wild or nonmodel organisms. RF is becoming increasingly used in ecological and population genetics because, unlike traditional methods, it can efficiently analyse thousands of loci simultaneously and account for nonadditive interactions. However, understanding both the power and limitations of Random Forest is important for its proper implementation and the interpretation of results. We therefore provide a practical introduction to the algorithm and its use for identifying associations between molecular markers and phenotypes, discussing such topics as data limitations, algorithm initiation and optimization, as well as interpretation. We also provide short R tutorials as examples, with the aim of providing a guide to the implementation of the algorithm. Topics discussed here are intended to serve as an entry point for molecular ecologists interested in employing Random Forest to identify trait associations in genomic data sets.},

  abstract = {Lek systems, where females often use centrality to assess male quality, highlight a general paradox in evolutionary biology: how can female preferences for males providing good genes persist when consequential strong directional selection is predicted to deplete additive genetic variance in male quality and thereby obliterate benefits of choosiness? An explanation contributing to the resolution of this lek paradox may be that genetic variance is retained when an indirect mate choice cue, such as centrality on a lek, is an imperfect indicator of male genetic quality. Here I investigate whether the presence of alternative male mating tactics limits the reliability of centrality as a quality indicator in lek-breeding topi antelopes. Whereas males establishing territories directly on the central lek were relatively large, smaller peripheral males regularly shifted their territories centripetally and in this way also occasionally obtained central territories. By such opportunistic queuing, small males could increase their mating success drastically; however, their territorial tenure in the lek centre was relatively short, consistent with moderate competitive ability. These results suggest that male topi antelopes can obtain central lek territories through alternative mating tactics, providing scope for variance in male quality on the central lek. In a separate finding, the mating success of central males was found to increase during territorial tenure, independent of estimated age. The demonstration of queuing in both space and time on a mammalian lek highlights the importance of considering male tactical dynamics over time in order to avoid an inflated appearance of the lek paradox.},

  abstract = {Hunting disturbance may affect individuals in a population by modifying their behaviour and spatial movements, which can lead to changes in home-range size and habitat use or displacement, for example into refuge areas. To evaluate effects of disturbance by recreational hunting activity, we conducted a study with 87 individually radio-marked willow ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus, in experimentally hunted and non-hunted units in central Norway during a fouryear period. Contrary to a common belief among many hunters, i.e. that willow ptarmigan abandon a hunting unit in response to hunting activity, none of the birds left hunted units during the first two weeks of the hunting season in our study. Neither, did hunting affect the size of areas used by the ptarmigan or the distance between locations on consecutive days. In fact, day-to-day movements tended to be longer in non-hunted units than in hunted units. Willow ptarmigan responded to the risk of being shot by increasing their use of habitat with dense forest/scrub cover, which provided secure escape sites where birds were more difficult to locate and to shoot by hunters using pointing dogs. The increased use of cover with secure escape sites found for willow ptarmigan indicates that the catch per unit effort of hunters will vary not only with population density, but also with the amount and distribution of dense forest/shrub habitat in hunted units. Where the site-specific catch per unit effort of hunters is difficult to predict, we recommend a management scheme of harvests based on allowing a predefined number of hunters to hunt for the whole season and a seasonal bag limit per hunter.},

  abstract = {Individual differences in animal behaviour influence ecological and evolutionary processes. Much behavioural variation has a heritable component, suggesting that genetics may play a role in its development. Yet, the study of the mechanistic description linking genes to behaviour in nature remains in its infancy, and such research is considered a challenge in contemporary biology. Here, we performed a literature review and meta-analysis to assess trends in analytical approaches used to investigate the relationship between genes and behaviour in natural systems, specifically candidate gene approaches, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We aimed to determine the efficacy and success of each approach, while also describing which behaviours and species were examined by researchers most often. We found that the majority of QTL mapping and GWAS results revealed a significant or suggestive effect (Zr = 0.3 [95\% CI: 0.25:0.35] and Zr = 0.39 [0.33:0.46], respectively) between the trait of interest and genetic marker(s) tested, while over half of candidate gene accounts (Zr = 0.16 [0.11:0.21]) did not find a significant association. Approximately a third of all study estimates investigated animal personality traits; though, reproductive and migratory behaviours were also wellrepresented. Our findings show that despite widespread accessibility of molecular approaches given current sequencing technologies, efforts to elucidate the genetic basis of behaviour in free-ranging systems has been limited to relatively few species. We discuss challenges encountered by researchers, and recommend integration of novel genomic methods with longitudinal studies to usher in the next wave of behavioural genomic research.},

There is an increasing awareness that the presented gender of authors can impact their acceptance at competitive venues, and also influence the support they receive to participate in conferences.

Recent research has examined these impacts in the context of related disciplines within computing and considered the gender profile of reviewers and authors at the iConference. This paper examines the impact of gender and geography on the representation of authors in the ASIST Annual Meeting and the JASIST journal. Through an evaluation of the first authors of accepted papers or articles, we assess the relative representation of genders, and the degree to which conference location impedes or enables authors from different regions. Our findings provide a foundation for the information science community to work towards better representation of female and international authors.},

  abstract = {To understand animal wellbeing, we need to consider subjective phenomena and sentience. This is challenging, since these properties are private and cannot be observed directly. Certain motivations, emotions and related internal states can be inferred in animals through experiments that involve choice, learning, generalization and decision-making. Yet, even though there is significant progress in elucidating the neurobiology of human consciousness, animal consciousness is still a mystery. We propose that computational animal welfare science emerges at the intersection of animal behaviour, welfare and computational cognition. By using ideas from cognitive science, we develop a functional and generic definition of subjective phenomena as any process or state of the organism that exists from the first-person perspective and cannot be isolated from the animal subject. We then outline a general cognitive architecture to model simple forms of subjective processes and sentience. This includes evolutionary adaptation which contains top-down attention modulation, predictive processing and subjective simulation by re-entrant (recursive) computations. Thereafter, we show how this approach uses major characteristics of the subjective experience: elementary self-awareness, global workspace and qualia with unity and continuity. This provides a formal framework for process-based modelling of animal needs, subjective states, sentience and wellbeing.},

Since most research to date on producer understandings of animal welfare has been based in Europe and North America, we used qualitative methods to examine producers' understandings of animal welfare in the red-meat (beef and sheep-meat) sectors in Australia. Through the use of interviews, we found that Australian producers linked ``good welfare'' with productivity and profitability and were willing to adopt new practices to improve animal welfare. Producers were concerned about negative public perceptions of their industry and suggested that education was needed to correct misinformation about the industry. Australian producers place significant emphasis on the relationship between climatic conditions and farm animal welfare, often describing their attempts to do the best they can in periods of adverse weather, a significant finding as awareness of climate change and its effects continues to increase. Our findings contribute to a broader effort to identify shared values between different stakeholder groups (i.e. producers, consumers, and the broader community) to highlight areas of commonality between these groups and provide more effective pathways for improving conversations about how to produce meat humanely and how animal welfare practices can continue to evolve and improve.},

  abstract = {Although there now exists a wide range of policies, instruments and regulations, in Europe and increasingly beyond, to improve and safeguard the welfare of farmed animals, there remain persistent and significant welfare issues in virtually all types of animal production systems ranging from high prevalence of lameness to limited possibilities to express natural behaviours. Protocols and indicators, such as those provided by Welfare Quality, mean that animal welfare can nowadays be regularly measured and surveyed at the farm level. However, the digital revolution in agriculture opens possibilities to quantify animal welfare using multiple sensors and data analytics. This allows daily monitoring of animal welfare at the group and individual animal level, for example, by measuring changes in behaviour patterns or physiological parameters. The present paper explores the potential for developing innovations in digital technologies to improve the management of animal welfare at the farm, during transport or at slaughter. We conclude that the innovations in Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) offer significant opportunities for a more holistic, evidence-based approach to the monitoring and surveillance of farmed animal welfare. To date, the emphasis in much PLF technologies has been on animal health and productivity. This paper argues that this emphasis should not come to define welfare. What is now needed is a coming together of industry, scientists, food chain actors, policy-makers and NGOs to develop and use the promise of PLF for the creative and effective improvement of farmed animal welfare.},

Evolutionary explanations for this diversity rely upon genetic variation, yet the heritability of complex phenotypes is seldom investigated in the field. Here, we estimate genomic heritability of advertisement song and body condition in a wild population of singing mice. The heritability of song exhibits a systematic pattern, with high heritability for spectral characteristics linked to vocal morphology, intermediate heritability for rhythmic patterns, and lower but significant heritability for measures of motivation, like song length and rate. Physiological measures of condition, like hormonal markers of adiposity, exhibited intermediate heritability. Among singing mice, song rate and body condition have a strong phenotypic correlation; our estimate suggests a comparable genetic correlation that merits further study. Our results illustrate how advances in genomics and quantitative genetics can be integrated in free-living species to address longstanding challenges in behavior and evolution.},

  abstract = {Identifying the molecular mechanisms involved in rapid adaptation to novel environments and determining their predictability are central questions in evolutionary biology and pressing issues due to rapid global changes. Complementary to genetic responses to selection, faster epigenetic variations such as modifications of DNA methylation may play a substantial role in rapid adaptation. In the context of rampant urbanization, joint examinations of genomic and epigenomic mechanisms are still lacking. Here, we investigated genomic (SNP) and epigenomic (CpG methylation) re sponses to urban life in a passerine bird, the Great tit (Parus major). To test whether urban evolution is predictable (i.e. parallel) or involves mostly nonparallel molecular processes among cities, we analysed both SNP and CpG methylation variations across three distinct pairs of city and forest Great tit populations in Europe. Our analyses reveal a polygenic response to urban life, with both many genes putatively under weak divergent selection and multiple differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between forest and city great tits. DMRs mainly overlapped transcription start sites and promotor regions, suggesting their importance in modulating gene expression. Both genomic and epigenomic outliers were found in genomic regions enriched for genes with biological functions related to the nervous system, immunity, or behavioural, hormonal and stress responses. Interestingly, comparisons across the three pairs of city-forest populations suggested little parallelism in both genetic and epigenetic responses. Our results confirm, at both the genetic and epigenetic levels, hypotheses of polygenic and largely nonparallel mechanisms of rapid adaptation in novel environ ments such as urbanized areas.},

Using 14 microsatellites, we compared the genetic differentiation of males among nine localities in continuous lowland habitats in Finland to the genetic differentiation among 14 localities in fragmented habitats in the Alps (France, Switzerland and Italy). In both areas, we found significant genetic differentiation. However, the average differentiation, measured as {\texttheta}, was more than three times higher in the Alps than in Finland. The greater differentiation found in the Alps is probably due to the presence of mountain ridges rising above natural habitats of the species, which form barriers to gene flow, and to a higher influence of genetic drift resulting from lower effective sizes in highly fragmented habitats. The detection of isolation by distance in the Alps suggests that gene flow among populations does occur. The genetic variability measured as gene diversity HE and allelic richness A was lower in the Alps than in Finland. This could result from the higher fragmentation and/or from the fact that populations in the Alps are isolated from the main species range and have a lower effective size than in Finland. This study suggests that habitat fragmentation can affect genetic structure of avian species with relatively high dispersal propensities.},

Survival rates for 93 black grouse               Tetrao tetrix               equipped with radio tags in two populations of the southern French Alps were estimated. Annual survival rates of hens (0.68, SE = 0.075, 0.84, SE = 0.105), but not of cocks (0.56, SE = 0.09, 0.66, SE = 0.122), tended to be higher than those of juveniles (0.52, SE = 0.071, sexes combined). The lower survival of juveniles was due to higher predation, mostly by raptors, in autumn and winter. Although both autumn and winter were seasons of peak mortality in juveniles, most adult deaths occurred either in spring (hens and cocks), or in early summer (cocks). Causes of mortality were as follows: raptors 51\%, mammalian predators 27\%, unidentified predators 11\%, and hunting 11\%. Principal raptors were golden eagl               tAquila chrysaetos               and goshawk               Accipiter gentilis.

Only males could be legally shot, and hunting was a minor mortality factor on our study areas. Nevertheless, the distorted adult sex ratio favouring hens that we observed on our study areas was probably due to hunting of males on and around the study areas. Sensitivity analysis showed that population growth is influenced more by adult survival than by either reproductive success or juvenile survival to one year of age. To prevent shooting from causing highly distorted spring sex ratios, which might compromise reproductive success, harvests should be reduced in years of poor reproduction, and shooting should be oriented towards juvenile males.},

While Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) outperforms exact methods through its use of heuristics, the speed of the current BLAST software is suboptimal for very long queries or database sequences. There are also some shortcomings in the user-interface of the current command-line applications.                                         Results               We describe features and improvements of rewritten BLAST software and introduce new command-line applications. Long query sequences are broken into chunks for processing, in some cases leading to dramatically shorter run times. For long database sequences, it is possible to retrieve only the relevant parts of the sequence, reducing CPU time and memory usage for searches of short queries against databases of contigs or chromosomes. The program can now retrieve masking information for database sequences from the BLAST databases. A new modular software library can now access subject sequence data from arbitrary data sources. We introduce several new features, including strategy files that allow a user to save and reuse their favorite set of options. The strategy files can be uploaded to and downloaded from the NCBI BLAST web site.                                         Conclusion               The new BLAST command-line applications, compared to the current BLAST tools, demonstrate substantial speed improvements for long queries as well as chromosome length database sequences.

  abstract = {We have developed a portable and easily configurable genome annotation pipeline called MAKER. Its purpose is to allow investigators to independently annotate eukaryotic genomes and create genome databases. MAKER identifies repeats, aligns ESTs and proteins to a genome, produces ab initio gene predictions, and automatically synthesizes these data into gene annotations having evidence-based quality indices. MAKER is also easily trainable: Outputs of preliminary runs are used to automatically retrain its gene-prediction algorithm, producing higher-quality gene-models on subsequent runs. MAKER's inputs are minimal, and its outputs can be used to create a GMOD database. Its outputs can also be viewed in the Apollo Genome browser; this feature of MAKER provides an easy means to annotate, view, and edit individual contigs and BACs without the overhead of a database. As proof of principle, we have used MAKER to annotate the genome of the planarian               Schmidtea mediterranea               and to create a new genome database, SmedGD. We have also compared MAKER's performance to other published annotation pipelines. Our results demonstrate that MAKER provides a simple and effective means to convert a genome sequence into a community-accessible genome database. MAKER should prove especially useful for emerging model organism genome projects for which extensive bioinformatics resources may not be readily available.},

  abstract = {The detection of human emotions has applicability in various domains such as assisted living, health monitoring, domestic appliance control, crowd behavior tracking real time, and emotional security. The paper proposes a new system for emotion classification based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) classifier. The generative adversarial networks have been widely used for generating realistic images, but the classification capabilities have been vaguely exploited. One of the main advantages is that by using the generator, we can extend our testing dataset and add more variety to each of the seven emotion classes we try to identify. Thus, the novelty of our study consists in increasing the number of classes from N to 2N (in the learning phase) by considering real and fake emotions. Facial key points are obtained from real and generated facial images, and vectors connecting them with the facial center of gravity are used by the discriminator to classify the image as one of the 14 classes of interest (real and fake for seven emotions). As another contribution, real images from different emotional classes are used in the generation process unlike the classical GAN approach which generates images from simple noise arrays. By using the proposed method, our system can classify emotions in facial images regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, age and face rotation. An accuracy of 75.2\% was obtained on 7000 real images (14,000, also considering the generated images) from multiple combined facial datasets.},

  abstract = {The attrition of women in academic careers is a major concern, particularly in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics subjects. One factor that can contribute to the attrition is the lack of visible role models for women in academia. At early career stages, the behaviour of the local community may play a formative role in identifying ingroup role models, shaping women's impressions of whether or not they can be successful in academia. One common and formative setting to observe role models is the local departmental academic seminar, talk, or presentation. We thus quantified women's visibility through the question-asking behaviour of academics at seminars using observations and an online survey. From the survey responses of over 600 academics in 20 countries, we found that women reported asking fewer questions after seminars compared to men. This impression was supported by observational data from almost 250 seminars in 10 countries: women audience members asked absolutely and proportionally fewer questions than male audience members. When asked why they did not ask questions when they wanted to, women, more than men, endorsed internal factors (e.g., not working up the nerve). However, our observations suggest that structural factors might also play a role; when a man was the first to ask a question, or there were fewer questions, women asked proportionally fewer questions. Attempts to counteract the latter effect by manipulating the time for questions (in an effort to provoke more questions) in two departments were unsuccessful. We propose alternative recommendations for creating an environment that makes everyone feel more comfortable to ask questions, thus promoting equal visibility for women and members of other less visible groups.},

Most studies have been conducted on coastal and wetland areas and showed that hunting activity can greatly affect bird behaviour and distribution. Hunting-free reserves for game species are zones where birds find an area of reduced disturbance. We evaluated the effect of hunting activities on the behaviour and use of hunting-free areas of lapwings Vanellus vanellus, golden plovers Pluvialis apricaria and little bustards Tetrax tetrax in agricultural areas. We compared the habitat use and behaviour of birds on days before, during and after hunting took place. All three studied species showed strong behavioural responses to hunting activities. Hunting activity increased flight probability and time spent vigilant (higher on hunting days than just before and after a hunting day), to the detriment of resting. We also found distributional (use of hunting-free reserve) responses to hunting activities, with hunting-free reserves being used more frequently during hunting days. Thus, reserves can mitigate the disturbance caused by hunting activities, benefiting threatened species in agricultural areas. Increasing the size or number of huntingfree areas might be an important management and conservation tool to reduce the impacts of hunting activities.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        There is growing evidence that anthropogenic landscapes can strongly influence the evolution of dispersal, particularly through fragmentation, and may drive organisms into an evolutionary trap by suppressing dispersal. However, the influence on dispersal evolution of anthropogenic variation in habitat patch turnover has so far been largely overlooked. In this study, we examined how human-driven variation in patch persistence affects dispersal rates and distances, determines dispersal-related phenotypic specialization, and drives neutral genetic structure in spatially structured populations. We addressed this issue in an amphibian,             Bombina variegata             , using an integrative approach combining capture--recapture modeling, demographic simulation, common garden experiments, and population genetics.             B. variegata             reproduces in small ponds that occur either in habitat patches that are persistent (i.e. several decades or more), located in riverine environments with negligible human activity, or in patches that are highly temporary (i.e. a few years), created by logging operations in intensively harvested woodland. Our capture--recapture models revealed that natal and breeding dispersal rates and distances were drastically higher in spatially structured populations (SSPs) in logging environments than in riverine SSPs. Population simulations additionally showed that dispersal costs and benefits drive the fate of logging SSPs, which cannot persist without dispersal. The common garden experiments revealed that toadlets reared in laboratory conditions have morphological and behavioral specialization that depends on their habitat of origin. Toadlets from logging SSPs were found to have higher boldness and exploration propensity than those from riverine SSPs, indicating transgenerationally transmitted dispersal syndromes. We also found contrasting patterns of neutral genetic diversity and gene flow in riverine and logging SSPs, with genetic diversity and effective population size considerably higher in logging than in riverine SSPs. In parallel, intra-patch inbreeding and relatedness levels were lower in logging SSPs. Controlling for the effect of genetic drift and landscape connectivity, gene flow was found to be higher in logging than in riverine SSPs. Taken together, these results indicate that anthropogenic variation in habitat patch turnover may have an effect at least as important as landscape fragmentation on dispersal evolution and the long-term viability and genetic structure of wild populations.},

Controlling for variation by demographic, discipline, and job factors, LGBTQ STEM professionals were more likely to experience career limitations, harassment, and professional devaluation than their non-LGBTQ peers. They also reported more frequent health difficulties and were more likely to intend to leave STEM. These trends were similar across STEM disciplines and employment sectors. We found no differences by LGBTQ status in education level, work effort, or job commitment. These findings reveal LGBTQ status as a clear axis of inequality in STEM and motivate further research into the mechanisms producing such outcomes.},

Here, we report conditional inactivation of Dnmt3b in HSCs either alone or combined with Dnmt3a deletion. Combined loss of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b was synergistic, resulting in enhanced HSC self-renewal and~a more severe block in differentiation than in Dnmt3a-null cells, whereas loss of Dnmt3b resulted in a mild phenotype. Although the predominant Dnmt3b isoform in adult HSCs is catalytically inactive, its residual activity in Dnmt3a-null HSCs can drive some differentiation and generates paradoxical hypermethylation of CpG islands. Dnmt3a/Dnmt3b-null HSCs displayed activated {$\beta$}-catenin signaling, partly accounting for the differentiation block. These data demonstrate distinct roles for Dnmt3b in HSC differentiation and provide insights into complementary de novo methylation patterns governing regulation of HSC fate decisions.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Understanding the evolutionary mechanisms underlying the maintenance of individual differences in behavior and physiology is a fundamental goal in ecology and evolution. The pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis is often invoked to explain the maintenance of such within-population variation. This hypothesis predicts that behavioral traits are part of a suite of correlated traits that collectively determine an individual's propensity to prioritize reproduction or survival. A key assumption of this hypothesis is that these traits are underpinned by genetic trade-offs among life-history traits: genetic variants that increase fertility, reproduction and growth might also reduce lifespan. We performed a systematic literature review and meta-analysis to summarize the evidence for the existence of genetic trade-offs between five key life-history traits: survival, growth rate, body size, maturation rate, and fertility. Counter to our predictions, we found an overall positive genetic correlation between survival and other life-history traits and no evidence for any genetic correlations between the non-survival life-history traits. This finding was generally consistent across pairs of life-history traits, sexes, life stages, lab vs. field studies, and narrow- vs. broad-sense correlation estimates. Our study highlights that genetic trade-offs may not be as common, or at least not as easily quantifiable, in animals as often assumed.},

  abstract = {Abstract             tRNAscan-SE has been widely used for transfer RNA (tRNA) gene prediction for over twenty years, developed just as the first genomes were decoded. With the massive increase in quantity and phylogenetic diversity of genomes, the accurate detection and functional prediction of tRNAs has become more challenging. Utilizing a vastly larger training set, we created nearly one hundred specialized isotype- and clade-specific models, greatly improving tRNAscan-SE's ability to identify and classify both typical and atypical tRNAs. We employ a new comparative multi-model strategy where predicted tRNAs are scored against a full set of isotype-specific covariance models, allowing functional prediction based on both the anticodon and the highest-scoring isotype model. Comparative model scoring has also enhanced the program's ability to detect tRNA-derived SINEs and other likely pseudogenes. For the first time, tRNAscan-SE also includes fast and highly accurate detection of mitochondrial tRNAs using newly developed models. Overall, tRNA detection sensitivity and specificity is improved for all isotypes, particularly those utilizing specialized models for selenocysteine and the three subtypes of tRNA genes encoding a CAU anticodon. These enhancements will provide researchers with more accurate and detailed tRNA annotation for a wider variety of tRNAs, and may direct attention to tRNAs with novel traits.},

  abstract = {Population epigenetics explores the extent of epigenetic variation and its dynamics in natural populations encountering changing environmental conditions. In contrast to population genetics, the basic concepts of this field are still in their early stages, especially in animal populations. Epigenetic variation may play a crucial role in phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation as it can be affected by the environment, it is likely to have higher spontaneous mutation rate than nucleotide sequences do, and it may be inherited via non-mendelian processes. In this review, we aim to bring together natural animal population epigenetic studies to generate new insights into ecological epigenetics and its evolutionary implications. We first provide an overview of the extent of DNA methylation variation and its autonomy from genetic variation in wild animal population. Second, we discuss DNA methylation dynamics which create observed epigenetic population structures by including basic population genetics processes. Then, we highlight the relevance of DNA methylation variation as an evolutionary mechanism in the extended evolutionary synthesis. Finally, we suggest new research directions by highlighting gaps in the knowledge of the population epigenetics field. As for our results, DNA methylation diversity was found to reveal parameters that can be used to characterize natural animal populations. Some concepts of population genetics dynamics can be applied to explain the observed epigenetic structure in natural animal populations. The set of recent advancements in ecological epigenetics, especially in transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in wild animal population, might reshape the way ecologists generate predictive models of the capacity of organisms to adapt to changing environments.},

Statistical methods based on population genetics theory have been applied to the resulting data and suggest that most mutations affecting functionally important sequences are deleterious but subject to very weak selection. Quantitative genetic studies have provided information on the extent of genetic variation within populations in traits related to fitness and the rate at which variability in these traits arises by mutation. This paper attempts to combine the available information from applications of the two approaches to populations of the fruitfly Drosophila in order to estimate some important parameters of genetic variation, using a simple population genetics model of mutational effects on fitness components. Analyses based on this model suggest the existence of a class of mutations with much larger fitness effects than those inferred from sequence variability and that contribute most of the standing variation in fitness within a population caused by the input of mildly deleterious mutations. However, deleterious mutations explain only part of this standing variation, and other processes such as balancing selection appear to make a large contribution to genetic variation in fitness components in Drosophila .},

Using population genetics models, numerical predictions of the genetic load, inbreeding depression and heterosis were obtained for a broad range of selection coefficients and mutation rates. The models allowed for the possibility of very high mutation rates per nucleotide site, as is sometimes observed for epiallelic mutations in plants. There was fairly good quantitative agreement between the theoretical predictions and empirical estimates of heterosis and the effects of population size on genetic load, on the assumption that the deleterious mutation rate per individual per generation is approximately one, but there was less good agreement for inbreeding depression. Weak selection, of the order of magnitude suggested by population genomic data, is required to explain the observed patterns. Possible caveats concerning the applicability of the models are discussed.},

  abstract = {A central goal of population genetics is to understand how genetic drift, natural selection, and gene flow shape allele frequencies through time. However, the actual processes underlying these changes---variation in individual survival, reproductive success, and movement---are often difficult to quantify. Fully understanding these processes requires the population pedigree, the set of relationships among all individuals in the population through time. Here, we use extensive pedigree and genomic information from a long-studied natural population of Florida Scrub-Jays (               Aphelocoma coerulescens               ) to directly characterize the relative roles of different evolutionary processes in shaping patterns of genetic variation through time. We performed gene dropping simulations to estimate individual genetic contributions to the population and model drift on the known pedigree. We found that observed allele frequency changes are generally well predicted by accounting for the different genetic contributions of founders. Our results show that the genetic contribution of recent immigrants is substantial, with some large allele frequency shifts that otherwise may have been attributed to selection actually due to gene flow. We identified a few SNPs under directional short-term selection after appropriately accounting for gene flow. Using models that account for changes in population size, we partitioned the proportion of variance in allele frequency change through time. Observed allele frequency changes are primarily due to variation in survival and reproductive success, with gene flow making a smaller contribution. This study provides one of the most complete descriptions of short-term evolutionary change in allele frequencies in a natural population to date.},

Endurance rivalry is when males compete for opportunities to mate by spending more time in leks than others (interaction-independent male-male competition). Because high-quality males can afford to have high lek attendance, females have a higher chance of mating with good-quality males even when they mate randomly. The good gene hypothesis proposes that females can pass good genes on to their offspring by choosing males that display elaborate morphological and/or behavioral traits that reflect the males' genetic quality. The relative importance of lek attendance and female choice to males' mating success in anurans is rarely evaluated. In this study, we investigated how these two mechanisms might jointly shape males' morphological traits in the lek-chorusing emerald treefrog                 Zhangixalus prasinatus                 .                                                        Results               Our results show that (1) male lek attendance is positively correlated with body size and condition, and males with higher lek attendance have higher mating success, (2) the dominant frequency of males' advertisement calls are negatively correlated with body size and males producing lower frequency calls have higher mating success, (3) male body size, but not body condition, has a non-significant positive relationship with mating success and (4) females show preference for calls with lower dominant frequencies in two-choice playback.                                         Conclusions               Overall, both endurance rivalry and female choice play an important role in the mating success of male emerald treefrogs in the field and both are influenced by male body size/condition. By mating with males that have higher lek attendance and produce lower frequency calls, selection may indirectly favor larger males.},

  abstract = {The Longlin goat is one of the most valuable livestock species in Guangxi Autonomous Region of China, but its genomic diversity and selective signals are not clearly elucidated. Here we compared 20 genomes of Longlin goat to 66 genomes of other seven goat breeds worldwide to analyze patterns of Longlin goat genetic variation. We found the lowest linkage disequilibrium at the large distances between SNPs associated with the highest effective population size in the recent generations ago in Longlin goat. The eight goat breeds could be divided into Euro-African and East Asian goat population. Interestingly, like East Asian taurine, the same two migration phases might have occurred in the history of East Asian goat. More importantly, we identified selective signals implicated in immune resistance to disease, especially for skin disease, in Longlin goat. Our findings will not only help understand the evolutionary history and breed characteristic but can provide valuable resources for conservation of germplasm resources and implementation of crossbreeding programs.},

Surprisingly, infectious diseases have not been accounted for in harvest models, which is a major oversight because the consequences of parasites for host population dynamics are well-established. Here, we present a simple general model for a host species subject to density dependent reproduction and seasonal demography. We assume this host species is subject to infection by a strongly immunizing, directly transmitted pathogen. In this context, we show that the interaction between density dependent effects and harvesting can substantially increase both disease prevalence and the absolute number of infectious individuals. This effect clearly increases the risk of cross-species disease transmission into domestic and livestock populations. In addition, if the disease is associated with a risk of mortality, then the synergistic interaction between hunting and disease-induced death can increase the probability of host population extinction.},

This is especially true in evolutionary theory where condition is now equated with reproductive value, genetic quality, or defined as the `total pool of resources available for reproduction.' Condition with the latter meaning is essentially impossible to measure empirically because it is associated with multiple attributes, such as nutritional state, health, experience, foraging success, ability to cope with environmental pressures, and social status, that collectively affect individual fitness. The addition of qualifying terms that often precede condition (e.g., phenotypic, energetic, and nutritional) and the usage of terms that describe an individual's state (e.g., physiological state, energetic state, and nutritional state) add confusion to the issue. It is therefore important to evaluate the meaning of condition, the limits of its usefulness, and how it can be best measured. We suggest using a more narrow definition of condition, amenable to empirical study, would benefit evolutionary and behavioral studies.},

These data are needed for the comprehensive evaluation of polar biodiversity and to reveal how life evolved and adapted to permanently cold environments with extreme seasonality.

The Scandinavian arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) is highly fragmented, with a once continuous, circumpolar distribution, it struggled to recover from a demographic bottleneck in the late 19th century. The future persistence of the entire Scandinavian population is highly dependent on the northernmost Fennoscandian subpopulations (Scandinavia and the Kola Peninsula), to provide a link to the viable Siberian population. By analyzing 43 arctic fox genomes, we quantified genomic variation and inbreeding in these populations. Signatures of genome erosion increased from Siberia to northern Sweden indicating a stepping-stone model of connectivity. In northern Fennoscandia, runs of homozygosity (ROH) were on average {\textasciitilde}1.47-fold longer than ROH found in Siberia, stretching almost entire scaffolds. Moreover, consistent with recent inbreeding, northern Fennoscandia harbored more homozygous deleterious mutations, whereas Siberia had more in heterozygous state. This study underlines the value of documenting genome erosion following population fragmentation to identify areas requiring conservation priority. With the increasing fragmentation and isolation of Arctic habitats due to global warming, understanding the genomic and demographic consequences is vital for maintaining evolutionary potential and preventing local extinctions.},

  abstract = {A capacity for the animal to recover quickly from the impact of physical and social stressors and disease challenges is likely to improve evolutionary fitness of wild species and welfare and performance of farm animals. Salience and valence of stimuli sensed through neurosensors, chemosensors and immunosensors are perceived and integrated centrally to generate emotions and engage physiological, behavioural, immune, cognitive and morphological responses that defend against noxious challenges. These responses can be refined through experience to provide anticipatory and learned reactions at lower cost than innate less-specific reactions. Influences of behaviour type, coping style, and affective state and the relationships between immune responsiveness, disease resistance and resilience are reviewed. We define resilience as the capacity of animals to cope with short-term perturbations in their environment and return rapidly to their pre-challenge status. It is manifested in response to episodic, sporadic or situation-specific attributes of the environment and can be optimised via facultative learning by the individual. It is a comparative measure of differences between individuals in the outcomes that follow exposure to potentially adverse situations. In contrast, robustness is the capacity to maintain productivity in a wide range of environments without compromising reproduction, health and wellbeing. Robustness is manifested in response to persistent or cyclical attributes of the environment and is effected via activity of innate regulatory pathways. We suggest that for farm animals, husbandry practices that incorporate physical and social stressors and interactions with humans such as weaning, change of housing, and introduction to the milking parlour can be used to characterise resilience phenotypes. In these settings, resilience is likely to be more readily identified through the rate of return of variables to pre-challenge or normal status rather than through measuring the activity of diverse stress response and adaptation mechanisms. Our strategy for phenotyping resilience of sheep and cattle during weaning is described. Opportunities are examined to increase resilience through genetic selection and through improved management practices that provide emotional and cognitive enrichment and stress inoculation.},

  abstract = {The rate of meiotic crossing over (CO) varies considerably along chromosomes, leading to marked distortions between physical and genetic distances. The causes underlying this variation are being unraveled, and DNA sequence and chromatin states have emerged as key factors. However, the extent to which the suppression of COs within the repeat-rich pericentromeric regions of plant and mammalian chromosomes results from their high level of DNA polymorphisms and from their heterochromatic state, notably their dense DNA methylation, remains unknown. Here, we test the combined effect of removing sequence polymorphisms and repeat-associated DNA methylation on the meiotic recombination landscape of an               Arabidopsis               mapping population. To do so, we use genome-wide DNA methylation data from a large panel of isogenic epigenetic recombinant inbred lines (epiRILs) to derive a recombination map based on 126 meiotically stable, differentially methylated regions covering 81.9\% of the genome. We demonstrate that the suppression of COs within pericentromeric regions of chromosomes persists in this experimental setting. Moreover, suppression is reinforced within 3-Mb regions flanking pericentromeric boundaries, and this effect appears to be compensated by increased recombination activity in chromosome arms. A direct comparison with 17 classical               Arabidopsis               crosses shows that these recombination changes place the epiRILs at the boundary of the range of natural variation but are not severe enough to transgress that boundary significantly. This level of robustness is remarkable, considering that this population represents an extreme with key recombination barriers having been forced to a minimum.},

  abstract = {Background:{\enspace} Understanding inbreeding and its impact on fitness and evolutionary potential is fundamental to species conservation and agriculture. Long stretches of homozygous genotypes, known as runs of homozygosity (ROH), result from inbreeding and their number and length can provide useful population-level information on inbreeding characteristics and locations of signatures of selection. However, the utility of ROH for conservation is limited for natural populations where baseline data and genomic tools are lacking. Comparing ROH metrics in recently feral vs. domestic populations of well understood species like the horse could provide information on the genetic health of those populations and offer insight into how such metrics compare between managed and unmanaged populations. Here we characterized ROH, inbreeding coefficients, and ROH islands in a feral horse population from Sable Island, Canada, using {\textasciitilde}41 000 SNPs and contrasted results with those from 33 domestic breeds to assess the impacts of isolation on ROH abundance, length, distribution, and ROH islands. Results:{\enspace} ROH number, length, and ROH-based inbreeding coefficients \-(FROH) in Sable Island horses were generally greater than in domestic breeds. Short runs, which typically coalesce many generations prior, were more abundant than long runs in all populations, but run length distributions indicated more recent population bottlenecks in Sable Island horses. Nine ROH islands were detected in Sable Island horses, exhibiting very little overlap with those found in domestic breeds. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis for Sable Island ROH islands revealed enrichment for genes associated with 3 clusters of biological pathways largely associated with metabolism and immune function. Conclusions:{\enspace} This study indicates that Sable Island horses tend to be more inbred than their domestic counterparts and that most of this inbreeding is due to historical bottlenecks and founder effects rather than recent mating between close relatives. Unique ROH islands in the Sable Island population suggest adaptation to local selective pressures and/or strong genetic drift and highlight the value of this population as a reservoir of equine genetic variation. This research illustrates how ROH analyses can be applied to gain insights into the population history, genetic health, and divergence of wild or feral populations of conservation concern.},

  abstract = {Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder whose pathogenesis relies on a maladaptive expression of the memory for a life-threatening experience, characterized by over-consolidation, generalization, and impaired extinction, which are responsible of dramatic changes in arousal, mood, anxiety, and social behavior. Even if subjects experiencing a traumatic event during lifetime all show an acute response to the trauma, only a subset of them (susceptible) ultimately develops PTSD, meanwhile the others (resilient) fully recover after the first acute response. However, the dynamic relationships between the interacting brain circuits that might potentially link trauma-related experiences to the emergence of susceptible and resilient PTSD phenotypes in individuals is not well understood. Toward the first step to reach this goal, we have implemented our experimental PTSD model previously developed, making it suitable to differentiate between susceptible (high responders, HR) and resilient (low responders, LR) rats in terms of over-consolidation, impaired extinction, and social impairment long after trauma. Rats were exposed to five footshocks paired with social isolation. One week after trauma but before extinction, animals were tested in the Open Field and Social Interaction tasks for the identification of a predictive variable to identify susceptible and resilient animals before the possible appearance of a PTSD-like phenotype. Our findings show that exploratory activity after trauma in a novel environment is a very robust variable to predict susceptibility towards a PTSD-like phenotype. This experimental model is thus able to screen and differentiate, before extinction learning and potential therapeutic intervention, susceptible and resilient PTSD-like rats.},

For females, 52\% of mortalities occurred during spring and summer and 46\% occurred in September-October. We rejected the hypothesis that time of death is independent of the gender of sage grouse.

  abstract = {Comparisons of orthologous genomic DNA sequences can be used to characterize regions that have been subject to purifying selection and are enriched for functional elements. We here present the results of such an analysis on an alignment of sequences from 29 mammalian species. The alignment captures {$\sim$}3.9 neutral substitutions per site and spans {$\sim$}1.9 Mbp of the human genome. We identify constrained elements from 3 bp to over 1 kbp in length, covering {$\sim$}5.5\% of the human locus. Our estimate for the total amount of nonexonic constraint experienced by this locus is roughly twice that for exonic constraint. Constrained elements tend to cluster, and we identify large constrained regions that correspond well with known functional elements. While constraint density inversely correlates with mobile element density, we also show the presence of unambiguously constrained elements overlapping mammalian ancestral repeats. In addition, we describe a number of elements in this region that have undergone intense purifying selection throughout mammalian evolution, and we show that these important elements are more numerous than previously thought. These results were obtained with Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling (GERP), a statistically rigorous and biologically transparent framework for constrained element identification. GERP identifies regions at high resolution that exhibit nucleotide substitution deficits, and measures these deficits as ``rejected substitutions.'' Rejected substitutions reflect the intensity of past purifying selection and are used to rank and characterize constrained elements. We anticipate that GERP and the types of analyses it facilitates will provide further insights and improved annotation for the human genome as mammalian genome sequence data become richer.},

However, the mechanisms underlying recognition and discrimination of genetically related or inbred individuals remain unclear. We investigated whether kinship and inbreeding information is related to low-frequency vocalizations, ``booms,'' produced by males during their courtship in the lekking houbara bustard (Chlamydotis undulata undulata). Based on a captive breeding program where the pedigree of all males is known, we investigated the similarity of booms' acoustic parameters among captive males more or less individually inbred and therefore genetically related with each other. In the wild, we investigated the relationship between the spatial distribution of males within leks and the similarity of acoustic parameters of their booms. In the captive population, we found (a) a relationship between the individual inbreeding level of captive males and their vocalization parameters; (b) that kin share similar frequency and temporal characteristics of their vocalizations. In the wild, we found no evidence for spatial structuring of males based on their acoustic parameters, in agreement with previous genetic findings on the absence of kin association within houbara bustard leks. Overall, our results indicate that genetic information potentially related to both the identity and quality of males is contained in their vocalizations.},

We investigated the dispersal patterns and genetic structure of lekking Black Grouse Tetrao tetrix based on ten microsatellite loci. Data for 469 individuals from 25 localities spaced from 45 to 558 km apart revealed low levels of genetic differentiation and high connectivity among studied sites due to female-biased dispersal. The spatial distribution of the genetic variation did not follow an isolation by distance pattern neither for females nor for males. STRUCTURE identified three clusters of male individuals but without any geographical pattern. Only one cluster was identified for females. Several tests of sex-biased dispersal were executed. Most of them showed no difference between sexes, but the mean assignment index and FIS showed a statistically significant female-biased dispersal. Therefore, we consider that the northern Swedish Black Grouse population is a panmictic population. The amount of gene flow throughout time has been consistent with dispersal and with no strong effect of forest fragmentation in the region.},

Here, we analyze a population of isogenic               Arabidopsis               lines that segregate experimentally induced DNA methylation changes at hundreds of regions across the genome. We demonstrate that several of these differentially methylated regions (DMRs) act as bona fide epigenetic quantitative trait loci (QTL               epi               ), accounting for 60 to 90\% of the heritability for two complex traits, flowering time and primary root length.

Currently available evidence suggests that oxidative stress may impart an important physiological cost on longevity, reproduction, immune response or intense physical activity. Given the gaps in our present knowledge, it is still premature to attempt to draw definitive conclusions and basic questions (e.g. how is oxidative stress generated and how do organisms cope with it?) have yet to be fully explored under natural conditions.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             Oxidative stress may be of profound biological relevance. In this Commentary, I discuss some key issues faced by the emerging field of oxidative stress ecology, and seek to provide interpretations and solutions. First, I show that the way in which we define oxidative stress has far-reaching implications for the interpretation of results, and that we need to distinguish between (1) a biochemical definition in terms of the molecular outcomes of oxidative stress (e.g. generation of oxidative damage) and (2) a biological definition in terms of the fitness consequences for the organism (e.g. effects on fertility). Second, I discuss the dangers of comparing different tissues and markers. Third, I highlight the need to pay more attention to the cross-talk between oxidative stress and other important physiological costs and functions; this will allow us to better understand the mechanistic basis of fitness costs. Fourth, I propose the `redox signalling hypothesis' of life history to complement the current `oxidative stress hypothesis' of life history. The latter states that oxidative damage underlies trade-offs because it affects traits like growth, reproduction or cell senescence. By contrast, the redox signalling hypothesis states that a trade-off between signalling and biochemical oxidative stress underlies the regulation of reactive oxygen species production and their subsequent control. Finally, I critically appraise our current knowledge of oxidative stress ecology, highlighting key research themes and providing an optimistic overview of future opportunities for the discipline to yield considerable insight into the ecological and evolutionary meaning of oxidative stress.},

We manipulated reproductive investment and predation regime in island populations of brown anole lizards (Anolis sagrei) to test (1) whether previously documented increases in the survival of experimentally non-reproductive females (OVX = ovariectomy) reflect the greater susceptibility of reproductive females (SHAM = control) to predation and (2) whether phenotypic selection differs as a function of reproductive investment and predation regime. OVX females exceeded SHAM controls in growth, mass gain and body condition, indicating pronounced energetic costs of reproduction. Although mortality was greatest in the presence of bird and snake predators, differences in survival between OVX and SHAM were unrelated to predation regime, as were patterns of natural selection on body size. Instead, we found that body condition at the conclusion of the experiment differed significantly across populations, suggesting that local environments varied in their ability to support mass gain and positive energy balance. As mean body condition improved across populations, the magnitude of the survival cost of reproduction increased, linear selection on body size shifted from positive to negative, and quadratic selection shifted from stabilizing to weakly disruptive. Our results suggest that reproductive trade-offs and patterns of phenotypic selection in female brown anoles are more sensitive to inferred variation in environmental quality than to experimentally induced variation in predation.},

In natural populations, both sexes may encounter affected as well as unaffected individuals during the breeding season, and any diminution in attractiveness could compromise reproductive success. Here we examine mate preference in male and female rats whose progenitors had been treated with the antiandrogenic fungicide vinclozolin. This effect is sex-specific, and we demonstrate that females three generations removed from the exposure discriminate and prefer males who do not have a history of exposure, whereas similarly epigenetically imprinted males do not exhibit such a preference. The observations suggest that the consequences of EDCs are not just transgenerational but can be ``transpopulational'', because in many mammalian species, males are the dispersing sex. This result indicates that epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of EDC action represents an unappreciated force in sexual selection. Our observations provide direct experimental evidence for a role of epigenetics as a determinant factor in evolution.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             Across many taxa, males use elaborate ornaments or complex displays to attract potential mates. Such sexually selected traits are thought to signal important aspects of male `quality'. Female mating preferences based on sexual traits are thought to have evolved because choosy females gain direct benefits that enhance their lifetime reproductive success (e.g. greater access to food) and/or indirect benefits because high-quality males contribute genes that increase offspring fitness. However, it is difficult to explain the persistence of female preferences when males only provide genetic benefits, because female preferences should erode the heritable genetic variation in fitness that sexually selected traits signal. This `paradox of the lek' has puzzled evolutionary biologists for decades, and inspired many hypotheses to explain how heritable variation in sexually selected traits is maintained. Here, we discuss how factors that affect mitochondrial function can maintain variation in sexually selected traits despite strong female preferences. We discuss how mitochondrial function can influence the expression of sexually selected traits, and we describe empirical studies that link the expression of sexually selected traits to mitochondrial function. We explain how mothers can affect mitochondrial function in their offspring by (a) influencing their developmental environment through maternal effects and (b) choosing a mate to increase the compatibility of mitochondrial and nuclear genes (i.e. the `mitonuclear compatibility model of sexual selection'). Finally, we discuss how incorporating mitochondrial function into models of sexual selection might help to resolve the paradox of the lek, and we suggest avenues for future research.},

  abstract = {Inbreeding depression, the reduction in fitness that accompanies inbreeding, is one of the most important topics of research in evolutionary and conservation genetics. In the recent literature, much attention has been paid to the possibility of purging the genetic load. If inbreeding depression is due to deleterious alleles, whose effect on fitness are negative when in a homozygous state, then successive generations of inbreeding may result in a rebound in fitness due to the selective decrease in frequency of deleterious alleles. Here we examine the experimental evidence for purging of the genetic load by collating empirical tests of rebounds in fitness-related traits with inbreeding in animals and plants. We gathered data from 28 studies including five mammal, three insect, one mollusc, and 13 plant species. We tested for purging by examining three measures of fitness-component variation with serial generations of inbreeding: (1) changes in inbreeding depression, (2) changes in fitness components of inbred lines relative to the original outbred line, and (3) purged population (outcrossed inbred lines) trait means as a function of ancestral outbred trait means. Frequent and substantial purging was found using all three measures, but was particularly pronounced when tracking changes in inbreeding depression. Despite this, we found little correspondence between the three measures of purging within individual studies, indicating that the manner in which a researcher chooses to estimate purging will affect interpretation of the results obtained. The discrepancy suggests an alternative hypothesis: rebounds in fitness with inbreeding may have resulted from adaptation to laboratory conditions and not to purging when using outcrossed inbred lines. However, the pronounced reduction in inbreeding depression for a number of studies provides evidence for purging, as the measure is likely less affected by selection for laboratory conditions. Unlike other taxonspecific reviews on this topic, our results provide support for the purging hypothesis, but firm predictions about the situations in which purging is likely or the magnitude of fitness rebound possible when populations are inbred remain difficult. Further research is required to resolve the discrepancy between the results obtained using different experimental approaches.},

Subjects were trained to manipulate a joystick that controlled movement of a cursor displayed on a computer monitor. The pigs were required to move the cursor to make contact with three-, two-, or one-walled targets randomly allocated for position on the monitor, and a reward was provided if the cursor collided with a target. The video-task acquisition required conceptual understanding of the task, as well as skilled motor performance. Terminal performance revealed that all pigs were significantly above chance on first attempts to contact one-walled targets (p {$<$} 0.05). These results indicate that despite dexterity and visual constraints, pigs have the capacity to acquire a joystick-operated video-game task. Limitations in the joystick methodology suggest that future studies of the cognitive capacities of pigs and other domestic species may benefit from the use of touchscreens or other advanced computer-interfaced technology.},

  abstract = {Natural selection acts on variation that is typically assumed to be genetic in origin. But epigenetic mechanisms, which are interposed between the genome and its environment, can create diversity independently of genetic variation. Epigenetic states can respond to environmental cues, and can be heritable, thus providing a means by which environmentally responsive phenotypes might be selectable independent of genotype. Here, we have tested the possibility that environment and selection can act together to increase the penetrance of an epigenetically determined phenotype. We used isogenic A vy mice, in which the epigenetic state of the A vy allele is sensitive to dietary methyl donors. By combining methyl donor supplementation with selection for a silent A vy allele, we progressively increased the prevalence of the associated phenotype in the population over five generations. After withdrawal of the dietary supplement, the shift persisted for one generation but was lost in subsequent generations. Our data provide the first demonstration that selection for a purely epigenetic trait can result in cumulative germline effects in mammals. These results present an alternative to the paradigm that natural selection acts only on genetic variation, and suggest that epigenetic changes could underlie rapid adaptation of species in response to natural environmental fluctuations.},

With extremely low levels of genetic diversity, limited options for mates, and variation in reproductive success across females, there is concern regarding the potential for genetic limitations of population growth from inbreeding depression. In this study, we quantified reproductive success of female North Atlantic right whales with a modified de-lifing approach using reproductive history information collected over decades of field observations. We used double-digest restriction site-associated sequencing to sequence approximately 2\% of the genome of 105 female North Atlantic right whales and combined genomic inbreeding estimates with individual fecundity values to assess evidence of inbreeding depression. Inbreeding depression could not explain the variance in reproductive success of females, however we present evidence that inbreeding depression may be affecting the viability of inbred fetuses---potentially lowering the reproductive success of the species as a whole. Combined, these results allay some concerns that genetic factors are impacting species survival as genetic diversity is being retained through selection against inbred fetuses. While still far fewer calves are being born each year than expected, the small role of genetics underlying variance in female fecundity suggests that variance may be explained by external factors that can potentially be mitigated through protection measures designed to reduce serious injury and mortality from human activities.},

The prevailing small population paradigm posits an elevated genetic load and extinction risk. However, instances of fast recovery from severe population bottlenecks suggest alternative outcomes. To investigate this issue, we performed a population genomic analysis on the black-necked crane, analyzing 42 modern and 11 historical genomes. This study revealed substantial evidence of large-effect allele purging underlying the unexpectedly rapid population recovery following an abrupt bottleneck during the 1980s. Nevertheless, forward simulations supposing a prolonged bottleneck (e.g., five generations) predicted a reversion with negative prospects, implying that rapid population recovery served as both the cause and consequence of the species escaping from an extinction vortex. These findings shed light on a potential positive microevolutionary response to current widespread population collapses and underscore the urgency of implementing active and effective conservation strategies to reverse this trend before it becomes irreversible.},

  abstract = {Significance             Despite widespread initiatives to promote gender diversity and inclusion in science, technology, engineering, and math, subtle barriers to women's success remain. We present evidence that men with stronger implicit stereotypes report socially including fewer women in the workplace. For women, the lack of social connections from men is linked to a lower sense of social fit and less workplace engagement. We discuss implications for how fostering positive cross-gender social relationships might benefit women and other marginalized groups in the workplace.           ,              Why are women socially excluded in fields dominated by men? Beyond the barriers associated with any minority group's mere numerical underrepresentation, we theorized that gender stereotypes exacerbate the social exclusion of women in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) workplaces, with career consequences. Although widely discussed, clear evidence of these relationships remains elusive. In a sample of 1,247 STEM professionals who work in teams, we tested preregistered hypotheses that acts of gendered social exclusion are systematically associated with both men's gender stereotypes (Part 1) and negative workplace outcomes for women (Part 2). Combining social network metrics of inclusion and reaction time measures of implicit stereotypes (the tendency to ``think STEM, think men''), this study provides unique empirical evidence of the chilly climate women often report experiencing in STEM. Men with stronger implicit gender stereotypes had fewer social ties to female teammates. In turn, women (but not men) with fewer incoming cross-gender social ties reported worse career fit and engagement. Moderated mediation revealed that for women (but not men), cross-gender social exclusion was linked to more negative workplace outcomes via lower social fit. Effects of social exclusion were distinct from respect. We discuss the possible benefits of fostering positive cross-gender social relationships to promote women's professional success in STEM.},

  abstract = {We conducted an experiment to test competing hypotheses regarding the effects of hunting on American black bear (Ursus americanus) demographic parameters. Specifically, we tested for the existence and the relative influence of sexually selected infanticide (SSI) and density dependence in regulating demographic parameters. We monitored 290 bears in 2 hunted areas and an adjoining unhunted area in the boreal forest of Alberta, Canada, during a 4-year study (2002--2005). We manipulated the areas using a modified before--after control--impact (BACI) design whereby bait sites for hunting were closed in 1 of the 2 hunted areas in years 3 and 4 and adult males in the unhunted area were removed in year 3. Results did not support a significant influence of SSI, if it occurs, on population parameters compared with the effects of density dependence. We found lower cub survival (66\% versus 83\%) and older age of first reproduction in the unhunted, higher-density area than in the lower-density, hunted area. We found no difference in body condition of males and females between areas, suggesting that if SSI restricted females to suboptimal areas, the effect was not strong enough to affect reproduction. We did not detect an influx of new males or a change in cub survival after removal of adult males from the unhunted area (66\% before versus 73\% after). Our results suggest that SSI does not affect the population growth rate of hunted black bear populations, and that target hunting quotas do not require including potential effects of SSI in population projections. However, SSI should be considered in unhunted or lightly hunted populations approaching carrying capacity (K). We advocate the inclusion of density dependence in population projection models for bear populations. However, for specific cases where harvesting maintains a population size well below K, density-dependent effects are predicted to be negligible due to the non-linear relationship between demographic parameters and density.},

VCF is usually stored in a compressed manner and can be indexed for fast data retrieval of variants from a range of positions on the reference genome. The format was developed for the 1000 Genomes Project, and has also been adopted by other projects such as UK10K, dbSNP and the NHLBI Exome Project. VCFtools is a software suite that implements various utilities for processing VCF files, including validation, merging, comparing and also provides a general Perl API.

We conducted an informal survey, yielding over 300 responses by volunteers at the meeting. Each response included gender data about a single talk given at the meeting, recording the gender of the speaker and all question-askers. In total, 225 individual AAS talks were sampled. We analyze basic statistical properties of this sample. We find that the gender ratio of the speakers closely matched the gender ratio of the conference attendees. The audience asked an average of 2.8 questions per talk. Talks given by women had a slightly higher number of questions asked (3.2{\textpm}0.2) than talks given by men (2.6{\textpm}0.1). The most significant result from this study is that while the gender ratio of speakers very closely mirrors that of conference attendees, women are under-represented in the question-asker category. We interpret this to be an age-effect, as senior scientists may be more likely to ask questions, and are more commonly men. A strong dependence on the gender of session chairs is found, whereby women ask disproportionately fewer questions in sessions chaired by men. While our results point to laudable progress in gender-balanced speaker selection, we believe future surveys of this kind would help ensure that collaboration at such meetings is as inclusive as possible.},

  abstract = {Dominance is important for access to resources. As dominance interactions are costly, individuals should be strategic in whom they interact with. One hypothesis is that individuals should direct costly interactions towards those closest in rank, as they have most to gain---in terms of attaining or maintaining dominance---from winning such interactions. Here, we show that male vulturine guineafowl (               Acryllium vulturinum               ), a gregarious species with steep dominance hierarchies, strategically express higher-cost aggressive interactions towards males occupying ranks immediately below themselves in their group's hierarchy. By contrast, lower-cost aggressive interactions are expressed towards group members further down the hierarchy. By directly evaluating differences in the strategic use of higher- and lower-cost aggressive interactions towards competitors, we show that individuals disproportionately use highest-cost interactions---such as chases---towards males found one to three ranks below themselves. Our results support the hypothesis that the costs associated with different interaction types can determine their expression in social groups with steep dominance hierarchies.

However, the evidence for this trade-off in wild populations is scarce. Cortisol also plays an important role in mediating the reproductive and immune functions. In this study, we analyzed whether the endoparasite burden relates to hormonal levels (fecal testosterone and cortisol metabolites) and/or morphological sexual traits (size of the dark ventral patch, a trait that indicates reproductive effort in males) in male Iberian red deer. For this purpose, we sampled male red deer harvested during hunting actions in 2 types of populations in south western Spain that differed in structure, affecting the level of male--male competition for mates. We used coprological analyses to estimate the parasite burden mainly of gastrointestinal and bronchopulmonary nematodes and of protozoa, and assessed testosterone and cortisol metabolite levels from fecal pellets. We found a positive relationship of host parasitation with both testosterone levels and the size of the dark ventral patch, but these relationships depended on the intensity of male--male competition in the population, being only found under the high-competition scenario. These results are discussed under the hypothesis of the testosterone immunocompetence handicap, suggesting a cost at the immunological level, and, therefore, higher susceptibility to parasite infection in males that make a greater reproductive effort. However, this effect seems to be modulated by the social environment (male--male competition) that might lead to different optima in testosterone production and sexual trait development.},

  abstract = {Background: Studies on vertebrate DNA methylomes have revealed a regulatory role of tissue specific DNA methylation in relation to gene expression. However, it is not well known how tissue-specific methylation varies between different functional and structural components of genes and genomes. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data we here describe both CpG and non-CpG methylation profiles of whole blood and brain tissue in relation to gene features, CpG-islands (CGIs), transposable elements (TE), and their functional roles in an ecological model species, the great tit (Parus major). Results: We show that hypomethylation at the transcription start site (TSS) is enriched in genes with functional classes that relate directly to processes specific to each tissue type. We find that 6877 ({\textasciitilde}21 \%) of the CGIs are differentially methylated between blood and brain, of which 1186 and 2055 are annotated to promoter and intragenic regions, respectively. We observe that CGI methylation in promoter regions is more conserved between tissues compared to CGI methylation in intra and inter-genic regions. Differentially methylated CGIs in promoter and intragenic regions are overrepresented in genomic loci linked to development, suggesting a distinct role for CGI methylation in regulating expression during development. Additionally, we find significant non-CpG methylation in brain but not in blood with a strong preference for methylation at CpA dinucleotide sites. Finally, CpG hypermethylation of TEs is significantly stronger in brain compared to blood, but does not correlate with TE activity. Surprisingly, TEs showed significant hypomethylation in non-CpG contexts which was negatively correlated with TE expression. Conclusion: The discovery that TSS methylation levels are directly linked to functional classes related to each tissue provides new insights in the regulatory role of DNA-methylation patterns. The dominant sequence motifs for brain non-CpG methylation, similar to those found in mammals, suggests that a conserved non-CpG regulatory mechanism was already present in the amniote ancestor. The negative correlation between brain non-CpG methylation and TE activity (not found for CpG methylation) suggests that non-CpG is the dominant regulatory form of methylation in TE silencing.},

Cage culture is being looked up as an opportunity to utilize existing inland water sources with great production potential to enhance production from inland open waters and posed as an answer to the rising demand for animal protein in the country. Freshwater cage culture is an important industry as it provides a source of protein and fulfills the high market demand for freshwater fishes. Poor water quality can result in low profit, low product quality and potential human health risks. Success, however, of the new aquaculture businesses greatly depended upon the suitability of the reservoir's water quality, its water quality variabilities, pollution and seasonal climatic and mixing events occurring in the new aquatic ecosystem. This paper gives detailed information on water quality parameters such as water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, alkalinity, hardness, nitrite, nitrate, ammonia, phosphate, sulphate, total dissolved solids and total suspended solids in freshwater fish culture as well as cage culture.},

  abstract = {The reduction of game and fish populations has increased investment in management practices. Hunting and fishing managers use several tools to maximize harvest. Managers need to know the impact their management has on wild populations. This issue is especially important to improve management efficacy and biodiversity conservation. We used questionnaires and field bird surveys in 48 hunting estates to assess whether red-legged partridge Alectoris rufa young/ adult ratio and summer abundance were related to the intensity of management (provision of supplementary food and water, predator control and releases of farm-bred partridges), harvest intensity or habitat in Central Spain. We hypothesized that partridge abundance would be higher where management practices were applied more intensively. Variation in young/ adult ratio among estates was best explained by habitat, year and some management practices. Density of feeders and water points had a positive relationship with this ratio, while the density of partridges released and magpies controlled were negatively related to it. The variables with greatest relative importance were feeders, releases and year. Variations in postbreeding red-legged partridge abundance among estates were best explained by habitat, year, the same management variables that influenced young/adult ratio, and harvest intensity. Harvest intensity was negatively related to partridge abundance. The other management variables had the same type of relationship with abundance as with young/adult ratio, except magpie control. Variables with greatest relative importance were habitat, feeders, water points, releases and harvest intensity. Our study suggests that management had an overall important effect on post-breeding partridge abundance. However, this effect varied among tools, as some had the desired effect (increase in partridge abundance), whereas others did not or even had a negative relationship (such as release of farm-reared birds) and can be thus considered inefficient or even detrimental. We advise reconsidering their use from both ecological and economical points of view.},

  abstract = {The maintenance of genetic variation in traits under strong sexual selection is a longstanding problem in evolutionary biology. The genic capture model proposes that this problem can be explained by the evolution of condition dependence in exaggerated male traits. We tested the predictions that condition dependence should be more pronounced in male sexual traits and that genetic variance in expression of these traits should increase under stress as among-genotype variation in overall condition is exposed. Genetic variance in female and nonsexual traits should, by contrast, be similar across environments as a result of stabilizing selection on trait expression. The relationship between the degree of sexual dimorphism, condition dependence and additive genetic variance (Va) was assessed for two morphological traits (body size and relative fore femur width) affecting male mating success in the black scavenger fly Sepsis punctum (Diptera: Sepsidae) and for development time (a nonsexual trait often correlated with body size). We compared trait expression between the sexes for two cross-continental populations that differ in degree of sexual dimorphism (Ottawa and Zurich). Condition dependence was indeed most pronounced in males of the strongly dimorphic Zurich population (males larger), and Va was similar for males and females unless the trait was strongly sex specific and condition dependent. Contrary to prediction, however, Va primarily increased under food limitation in both sexes, and genetic variance in fore femur width was low to nil, perhaps depleted by putatively strong sexual selection. Solely for body size of Zurich males, Va increased more in males than females at limited food, in accordance with the predictions of the genic capture model. Overall therefore, quantitative genetic evidence in support of the model was inconsistent and weak at best.},

Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases.             Results: To align our large (\&gt;80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of \&gt;50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 {\texttimes} 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80--90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.             Availability and implementation: STAR is implemented as a standalone C++ code. STAR is free open source software distributed under GPLv3 license and can be downloaded from http://code.google.com/p/rna-star/.             Contact: ~dobin@cshl.edu.},

Bare-skin signals are an understudied aspect of avian colouration compared with plumage studies, despite displaying rapid changes in size and colour in response to different environmental or physiological stressors. Even fewer studies have focused on the underlying histology of these structures and the importance this plays in the resulting skin colour. Using the Black Grouse               (Lyrurus tetrix)               , we identified the underlying structure of individual dermal spikes, which make up the red supra-orbital comb (a known integumentary signal of male quality), and highlight visual structural differences between combs of different sizes. In addition, we used Raman spectroscopy to indicate the presence of carotenoids within the tissue, something that had previously only been inferred through characteristic reflectance patterns. An increased understanding of the structural basis of colour of featherless parts of the skin opens up exciting new avenues for interpreting the information content of integumentary signals.},

Op\- tions for increasing numbers of the species are habitat management to counter overgrazing (in North Africa and the Middle East), mitigation of powerline collisions, predator control (ethically questionable and impractical), reduction of poaching and trapping, limited captive breeding, and hunting controls. Assuming hunting continues, the best model for conserving both species is a system of sustainable hunting that incorporates stakeholder observance, involvement of stakeholders and local communities in decisions and monitoring, protection of nohunting areas, scientifically-determined quotas, small-scale use of captive-bred birds, and---if numbers still fail to respond, as a last resort---moratoria.

  abstract = {After extinction in the wild in the beginning of the 20th century, the European bison has been successfully recovered in 2 distinct genetic lines from only 12 and 7 captive founders. We here aimed at characterizing the levels of realized inbreeding in these 2 restored lines to provide empirical insights into the genomic footprints left by population recovery from a small number of founders. To that end, we genotyped 183 European bison born over the last 40 years with the Illumina BovineHD beadchip that contained 22 602 informative autosomal single-nucleotide polymorphisms after data filtering. We then identified homozygous-by-descent (HBD) segments and classified them into different age-related classes relying on a model-based approach. As expected, we observed that the strong and recent founder effect experienced by the 2 lines resulted in very high levels of recent inbreeding and in the presence of long HBD tracks (up to 120 Mb). These long HBD tracks were associated with ancestors living approximately from 4 to 32 generations in the past, suggesting that inbreeding accumulated over multiple generations after the bottleneck. The contribution to inbreeding of the most recent groups of ancestors was however found to be decreasing in both lines. In addition, comparison of Lowland individuals born at different time periods showed that the levels of inbreeding tended to stabilize, HBD segments being shorter in animals born more recently which indicates efficient control of inbreeding. Monitoring HBD segment lengths over generations may thus be viewed as a valuable genomic diagnostic tool for populations in conservation or recovery programs.},

  abstract = {Epigenome modulation potentially provides a mechanism for organisms to adapt, within and between generations. However, neither the extent to which this occurs, nor the mechanisms involved are known. Here we investigate DNA methylation variation in Swedish Arabidopsis thaliana accessions grown at two different temperatures. Environmental effects were limited to transposons, where CHH methylation was found to increase with temperature. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) revealed that the extensive CHH methylation variation was strongly associated with genetic variants in both cis and trans, including a major trans-association close to the DNA methyltransferase CMT2. Unlike CHH methylation, CpG gene body methylation (GBM) was not affected by growth temperature, but was instead correlated with the latitude of origin. Accessions from colder regions had higher levels of GBM for a significant fraction of the genome, and this was associated with increased transcription for the genes affected. GWAS revealed that this effect was largely due to trans-acting loci, many of which showed evidence of local adaptation.           ,              Organisms need to adapt quickly to changes in their environment. Mutations in the DNA sequence of genes can lead to new adaptations, but this can take many generations. Instead, altering how genes are switched on by changing how the DNA is packaged in cells can allow organisms to adapt within and between generations. One way that genes are controlled in organisms is by a process known as DNA methylation, where `methyl' tags are added to DNA and act as markers for other proteins involved in activating genes.             DNA is made of four different molecules called `nucleotides' that are arranged in different orders to produce a vast variety of DNA sequences. One type of DNA methylation can happen at sites where a nucleotide called cytosine is followed by two other non-cytosine nucleotides. Another type of methylation can take place at sites where a cytosine is followed by a guanine nucleotide. However, it is not clear how big a role DNA methylation plays in allowing organisms to adapt to their changing environment.             Here, Dubin, Zhang, Meng, Remigereau et al. studied DNA methylation in a plant called Arabidopsis thaliana. Several different varieties of A. thaliana plants from Sweden were grown at two different temperatures. The experiments showed that the A. thaliana plants grown at higher temperatures were more likely to have methyl tags attached to sections of DNA called transposons, which are able to move around the genome. There was a lot of variety in the levels of this DNA methylation in the different plants, and some of it was shown to be associated with variation in a gene that is involved in DNA methylation.             However, not all of the DNA methylation in these plants was sensitive to the temperature the plants were grown in. Dubin, Zhang, Meng, Remigereau et al. show that the pattern of a type of DNA methylation that is found within genes depends on how far north in Sweden the plants' ancestors came from rather than the temperature the plants were grown in. Plants that originated from colder regions, farther north, had more DNA methylation within many genes and these genes were more active.             These findings suggest that genetic differences in these plants strongly influence the levels of DNA methylation, and they provide the first direct link between DNA methylation and adaption to the environment. Future studies should reveal how DNA methylation is regulated in these plants, and whether it plays a key role in adaptation, or merely reflects other changes in the genome.},

We used the preferences of               Drosophila melanogaster               females to exert bidirectional selection on competitive male mating success to test for the presence and nature of genetic variation underlying this multivariate trait. Male mating success diverged between selection regimens, and flies from success-selected lines had a smaller burden of deleterious, recessive mutations that affect egg-to-adult viability, were better sperm competitors (sperm offence), and did not demonstrate reduced desiccation resistance or components of female fitness (traits thought to trade off with attractiveness) relative to flies from failure-selected populations. Mating success remained subject to inbreeding depression in success-selected lines, suggesting that variation in mating success remains, thanks to numerous genes of small effect. Together, our results provide unique evidence for the evolutionary divergence in male mating success, demonstrating that genetic variation is not exhausted along the axis of precopulatory sexual selection and that female mating biases align with the avoidance of bad genes.},

We then resequenced the genomes of flies from each population. Consistent with the central predictions of the genic capture hypothesis, we show that genetic variance decreased with success selection and increased with failure selection, providing evidence for purifying sexual selection. This pattern was distributed across the genome and no consistent molecular pathways were associated with divergence, consistent with condition being the target of selection. Together, our results provide molecular evidence suggesting that strong sexual selection erodes genetic variation, and that genome-wide mutation-selection balance contributes to its maintenance.},

This phenomenon, known as phenotypic plasticity, is common amongst plants and animals, but arguably the most striking examples are seen in insects. Wellknown insect examples include seasonal morphs of butterfly wing patterns, sexual and asexual reproduction in aphids, and queen and worker castes of eusocial insects. Ultimately, we need to understand how phenotypic plasticity works at a mechanistic level; how do environmental signals alter gene expression, and how are changes in gene expression translated into novel morphology, physiology and behaviour? Understanding how plasticity works is of major interest in evolutionarydevelopmental biology and may have implications for understanding how insects respond to global change. It has been proposed that epigenetic mechanisms, specifically DNA methylation, are the key link between environmental cues and changes in gene expression. Here, we review the available evidence on the function of DNA methylation of insects, the possible role(s) for DNA methylation in phenotypic plasticity and also highlight key outstanding questions in this field as well as new experimental approaches to address these questions.},

However, there is uncertainty about whether resequencing data can provide accurate and consistent inbreeding estimates. Here, we performed an in-\-depth inbreeding analysis for hihi (Notiomystis cincta), an endemic and nationally vulnerable passerine bird of Aotearoa New Zealand. We first focused on subsampling variants from a reference genome male, and found that low-\-density data sets tend to miss runs of homozygosity (ROH) in some places and overestimate ROH length in others, resulting in contrasting homozygosity landscapes. Low-\-coverage resequencing and 50 K SNP array densities can yield comparable inbreeding results to high-\-coverage resequencing approaches, but the results for all data sets are highly dependent on the software settings employed. Second, we extended our analysis to 10 hihi where low-\-coverage whole genome resequencing, RAD-\-seq and SNP array genotypes are available. We inferred ROH and individual inbreeding to evaluate the relative effects of sequencing depth versus SNP density on estimating inbreeding coefficients and found that high rates of missingness downwardly bias both the number and length of ROH. In summary, when using genomic data to evaluate inbreeding, studies must consider that ROH estimates are heavily dependent on analysis parameters, data set density and individual sequencing depth.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            For small and isolated populations, the increased chance of mating between related individuals can result in a substantial reduction in individual and population fitness. Despite the increasing availability of genomic data to measure inbreeding accurately across the genome, inbreeding depression studies for threatened species are still scarce due to the difficulty of measuring fitness in the wild. Here, we investigate inbreeding and inbreeding depression for the extensively monitored Tiritiri M{\=a}tangi island population of a threatened Aotearoa New Zealand passerine, the hihi (               Notiomystis cincta               ). First, using a custom 45\,k single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, we explore genomic inbreeding patterns by inferring homozygous segments across the genome. Although all individuals have similar levels of ancient inbreeding, highly inbred individuals are affected by recent inbreeding, which can probably be explained by bottleneck effects such as habitat loss after European arrival and their translocation to the island in the 1990s. Second, we investigate genomic inbreeding effects on fitness, measured as lifetime reproductive success, and its three components, juvenile survival, adult annual survival and annual reproductive success, in 363 hihi. We find that global inbreeding significantly affects juvenile survival but none of the remaining fitness traits. Finally, we employ a genome-wide association approach to test the locus-specific effects of inbreeding on fitness, and identify 13 SNPs significantly associated with lifetime reproductive success. Our findings suggest that inbreeding depression does impact hihi, but at different genomic scales for different traits, and that purging has therefore failed to remove all variants with deleterious effects from this population of conservation concern.},

  abstract = {Due to the increasing scale of farms, it is increasingly difficult for farmers to monitor their animals in an automated way. Because of this problem, we focused on a sound technique to monitor laying hens. Sound analysis has become an important tool for studying the behaviour, health and welfare of animals in recent years. A surveillance system using microphone arrays of Kinects was developed for automatically monitoring birds' abnormal vocalisations during the night. Based on the principle of time-difference of arrival (TDOA) of sound source localisation (SSL) method, Kinect sensor direction estimations were very accurate. The system had an accuracy of 74.7\% in laboratory tests and 73.6\% in small poultry group tests for different area sound recognition. Additionally, flocks produced an average of 40 sounds per bird during feeding time in small group tests. It was found that, on average, each normal chicken produced more than 53 sounds during the daytime (noon to 6:00 p.m.) and less than one sound at night (11:00 p.m.--3:00 a.m.). This system can be used to detect anomalous poultry status at night by monitoring the number of vocalisations and area distributions, which provides a practical and feasible method for the study of animal behaviour and welfare.},

  abstract = {The ka ka po  is a flightless parrot endemic to New Zealand. Once common in the archipelago, only 201 individuals remain today, most of them descending from an isolated island population. We report the first genome-wide analyses of the species, including a high-quality genome assembly for ka ka po , one of the first chromosome-level reference genomes sequenced by the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). We also sequenced and analyzed 35 modern genomes from the sole surviving island population and 14 genomes from the extinct mainland population. While theory suggests that such a small population is likely to have accumulated deleterious mutations through genetic drift, our analyses on the impact of the long-term small population size in ka ka po  indicate that present-day island ka ka po  have a reduced number of harmful mutations compared to mainland individuals. We hypothesize that this reduced mutational load is due to the island population having been subjected to a combination of genetic drift and purging of deleterious mutations, through increased inbreeding and purifying selection, since its isolation from the mainland \$10,000 years ago. Our results provide evidence that small populations can survive even when isolated for hundreds of generations. This work provides key insights into ka ka po  breeding and recovery and more generally into the application of genetic tools in conservation efforts for endangered species.},

  abstract = {Parasite-host relationships are influenced by several factors intrinsic to hosts, such as social standing, group membership, sex, and age. However, in wild populations, temporal variation in parasite distributions and concomitant infections can alter these patterns. We used microscropy and molecular methods to screen for naturally occurring haemoparasitic infections in two Neotropical primate host populations, the saddleback (Leontocebus weddelli) and emperor (Saguinus imperator) tamarin, in the lowland tropical rainforests of southeastern Peru. Repeat sampling was conducted from known individuals over a three-year period to test for parasite-host and parasite-parasite associations. Three parasites were detected in L.~weddelli including Trypanosoma minasense, Mansonella mariae, and Dipetalonema spp., while S.~imperator only hosted the latter two. Temporal variation in prevalence was observed in T.~minasense and Dipetalonema spp., confirming the necessity of a multi-year study to evaluate parasite-host relationships in this system. Although callitrichids display a distinct reproductive dominance hierarchy, characterized by single breeding females that typically mate polyandrously and can suppress the reproduction of subdominant females, logistic models did not identify sex or breeding status as determining factors in the presence of these parasites. However, age class had a positive effect on infection with M.~mariae and T.~minasense, and adults demonstrated higher parasite species richness than juveniles or sub-adults across both species. Body weight had a positive effect on the presence of Dipetalonema spp. The inclusion of co-infection variables in statistical models of parasite presence/absence data improved model fit for two of three parasites. This study verifies the importance and need for broad spectrum and long-term screening of parasite assemblages of natural host populations.},

  abstract = {Background Over the past four decades there have been a number of controversies arising from the discussion of `equity' and `equality'. These concepts are often invoked by policy analysts, policy-makers, government officials and scholars in order to justify or critique resource allocation to different levels of the educational system. Purpose By creating a new equality--equity goal-oriented model, which allows the combination of different dimensions for each concept with different stages of the educational process, this paper aims to achieve two purposes: (1) to clarify among researchers, educators, evaluators, policy analysts, and policy-makers the notions of `equality' and `equity'; and (2) to encourage researchers and evaluators to critically examine and synthesize equality/equity-based research. Sources of evidence A review of the literature concerning the meaning, goals and assumptions of the concepts `equity' and `equality', and their implications for social and public policy, is presented. Main argument A survey of recent and earlier debates on `equity' and `equality' among scholars and researchers reveals disagreement and confusion about what those concepts really mean and what they involve in terms of goals and results. It is debatable whether we can have `equity' and `equality' in a society that prioritizes efficiency in resource management over social justice. Certainly, such questions have shaped and guided many discussions and theoretical debates among scholars, policy analysts and policy-makers. Conclusions Most of the definitions of `equity' and `equality' are frequently used by many researchers, evaluators, policy-makers, policy analysts, scholars and educators as if they were interchangeable. Instead of arguing for a unique or simple conception of `equity' and `equality', a set of definitions of those concepts as well as a discussion related to theoretical and policy issues associated are presented. In order to avoid that confusion, the equality--equity model developed in this paper suggests several new directions for analysis and research. It provides some ideas about how `equity' (i.e. `equity for equal needs', `equity for equal potential' and `equity for equal achievement') and `equality' (i.e. `equality of opportunity', `equality for all' and `equality on average across social groups') could be treated and measured in future research in relation to different features of the educational process (availability of resources, access, survival, output and outcome).},

For students and early-\-career researchers, especially those from underrepresented backgrounds, in-\-person conferences are challenging to attend due to the burdens on finances and time. However, as COVID-\-19 continues to restrict scientific societies' abilities to host large, in-\-person conferences, virtual conferences have increased in prevalence. For students and early-\-career researchers, virtual conferences present a multitude of benefits, including reduced attendance costs, increased accessibility to a wider range of conference resources, and reduced levels of anxiety. These factors make virtual conferences more accessible to those historically excluded from science. Further, microcommunities, which we define as a small network of individuals in the same career stage, can provide additional support for students via interacting closely with peers of the same identity, constructing workshops, and fostering belongingness in STEM. In this paper, we discuss the benefits associated with virtual conferences (focusing on students of underrepresented backgrounds), and we suggest methods to continue increasing inclusivity in STEM and scientific conferences as the world continues to adapt in response to the COVID-1\-9 pandemic.},

  abstract = {Many populations have recovered from severe bottlenecks either naturally or through intensive conservation management. In the past, however, few conservation programs have monitored the genetic health of recovering populations. We conducted a conservation genetic assessment of a small, reintroduced population of Mauritius Kestrel (Falco punctatus) to determine whether genetic deterioration has occurred since its reintroduction. We used pedigree analysis that partially accounted for individuals of unknown origin to document that (1) inbreeding occurred frequently (2.6\% increase per generation; NeI = 18.9), (2) 25\% of breeding pairs were composed of either closely or moderately related individuals, (3) genetic diversity has been lost from the population (1.6\% loss per generation; NeV = 32.1) less rapidly than the corresponding increase in inbreeding, and (4) ignoring the contribution of unknown individuals to a pedigree will bias the metrics derived from that pedigree, ultimately obscuring the prevailing genetic dynamics. The rates of inbreeding and loss of genetic variation in the subpopulation of Mauritius Kestrel we examined were extreme and among the highest yet documented in a wild vertebrate population. Thus, genetic deterioration may affect this population's long-term viability. Remedial conservation strategies are needed to reduce the impact of inbreeding and loss of genetic variation in this species. We suggest that schemes to monitor genetic variation after reintroduction should be an integral component of endangered species recovery programs.},

The proportion of mutations that are advantageous, effectively neutral and deleterious varies between species, and the DFE differs between coding and non-coding DNA. Despite these differences between species and genomic regions, some general principles have emerged: advantageous mutations are rare, and those that are strongly selected are exponentially distributed; and the DFE of deleterious mutations is complex and multi-modal.},

  abstract = {A model is investigated in which mutations that affect a complex trait (e.g., heart disease) also affect fitness because the trait is a component of fitness or because the mutations have pleiotropic effects on fitness. The model predicts that the genetic variance, and hence the heritability, in the trait is contributed by mutations at low frequency in the population, unless the mean strength of selection of mutations that affect the trait is very small or weakly selected mutations tend to contribute disproportionately to the trait compared with strongly selected mutations. Furthermore, it is shown that each rare mutation tends to contribute more to the variance than each common mutation. These results may explain why most genome-wide association studies have failed to find associations that explain much of the variance. It is also shown that most of the variance in fitness contributed by new nonsynonymous mutations is caused by mutations at very low frequency in the population. This implies that most low-frequency SNPs, which are observed in current resequencing studies of, for example, 100 chromosomes, probably have little impact on the variance in fitness or traits. Finally, it is shown that the variance contributed by a category of mutations (e.g., coding or regulatory) depends largely upon the mean strength of selection; this has implications for understanding which types of mutations are likely to be responsible for the variance in fitness and inherited disease.},

  abstract = {In breeding programs, using appropriate models to estimate the variance components with high accuracy is essential. Considering the non-additive genetic effects along with additive effects in evaluation analysis models can be effective in increasing the accuracy of estimates. This study was conducted to fit the best model for estimation of variance components of humoral immune responses (antibody titers against sheep red blood cells [SRBC] and Newcastle disease virus [NDV]), especially non-additive genetic effects (dominance and epistasis) in Japanese quail. The collected records of humoral immune responses were used to estimate genetic parameters using the Bayesian method via Gibbs sampling by fitting 24 different models. The best model for each trait was selected based on Deviance Information Criteria (DIC). Moreover, the residual and additive genetic variance changes were evaluated comparing the models. The results showed that dominance, epistasis, and maternal genetic effects were influenced on humeral immune responses traits except for immunoglobulin Y (IgY). The direct heritability for total antibody titer (AbT), the titer of immunoglobulin Y (IgY), the titer of immunoglobulin M (IgM) against SRBC, antibody titer against NDV (AbNDV), and immune system performance index (IgF) were 0.065, 0.208, 0.117, 0.100, and 0.132, respectively. The contribution of dominance and epistasis as a proportion of phenotypic variance for all traits ranged from 0.070 to 0.221, and 0.087 to 0.251, respectively. A reduction in residual variance were observed in all traits, moreover accuracy of estimated breeding values increased in some traits with adding non-additive genetic effects in the models. Furthermore, the additive genetic variance in the best models decreased for AbT, IgF, and AbNDV traits compared with the simple model (without non-additive genetic effects). The results suggested including the non-additive genetic effects in the genetic models for evaluation of humoral immune responses of quail to obtain precise genetic parameters.},

  abstract = {Keynote and plenary speakers at professional conferences serve as highly visible role models for early-career scientists and provide recognition of scientific excellence. This recognition may be particularly important for women, who are underrepresented in senior positions in the biological sciences. To evaluate whether conferences fulfill this potential, we examined distinguished speakers at North American ecology conferences between 2000 and 2015 and compared these data with the percentage of women ecologists at diverse career stages. We found that 15\%--35\% (x-- = 28\%, n = 809) of the distinguished speakers were women, which is significantly lower than the percentage of female ecology graduate students (x-- = 55\%, n = 26,802) but consistent with the percentage of women in assistant- and associate-faculty positions. We recommend that conference organizers institute policies to enhance speaker gender balance, to provide support for speakers with family responsibilities, and to actively monitor gender-related trends in their societies to achieve the equitable representation of women in distinguished speaking roles.},

Such epigenetic inheritance can have significant impact on eco-evolutionary dynamics, but the phenomenon remains controversial in ecological model systems. Here, we used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing on individual water fleas (             Daphnia magna             ) to assess whether environmentally-induced DNA methylation can persist for up to four generations. Genetically identical females were exposed to a control treatment, one of three natural stressors (high temperature, zinc, microcystin), or the methylation-inhibitor 5-azacytidine. After exposure, lines were propagated clonally for four generations under control conditions. We identified between 70 and 225 differentially methylated CpG positions (DMPs) between controls and F1 individuals whose mothers (and therefore they themselves as germ cells) were exposed to one of the three natural stressors. Between 46\% and 58\% of these environmentally-induced DMPs persisted until generation F4 without attenuation in their magnitude of differential methylation. DMPs were enriched in exons and largely stressor-specific, suggesting a possible role in environment-dependent gene regulation. In contrast, treatment with the compound 5-azacytidine demonstrated that pervasive hypo-methylation upon exposure is reset almost completely after a single generation. These results suggest that environmentally-induced DNA methylation is non-random and stably inherited across generations in             Daphnia             , making epigenetic inheritance a putative factor in the eco-evolutionary dynamics of fresh-water communities.                                   Author summary                            Water fleas are important keystone species mediating eco-evolutionary dynamics in lakes and ponds. It is currently an open question in how far epigenetic inheritance contributes to the ability of               Daphnia               populations to adapt to environmental stress. Using a range of naturally occurring stressors and a multi-generational design, we show that environmentally-induced DNA methylation variants are stably inherited for at least four generations in               Daphnia magna               . The induced variation in DNA methylation are stressor-specific and almost exclusively found in exons, bearing the signatures of functional adaptations. Our findings imply that ecological adaptations of               Daphnia               to seasonal fluctuations can be underpinned by epigenetic inheritance of DNA methylation without changes in gene frequencies.},

While several studies recently investigated the dynamics of deleterious mutations in wild populations, no study has yet explored the fate of deleterious mutations in a context of populations managed by supplementation. Here, based on a dataset of nine wild and 15 supplemented Lake Trout populations genotyped at 4,982 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)s by means of genotype by sequencing (GBS), we explored the effect of supplementation on the frequency of putatively deleterious variants. Three main findings are consequential for the management of fish populations. First, an increase in neutral genetic diversity in stocked populations compared with unstocked ones was observed. Second, putatively deleterious mutations were more likely to be found in unstocked than in stocked populations, suggesting a lower efficiency to purge deleterious mutations in unstocked lakes. Third, a population currently used as a major source for supplementation is characterized by several fixed putatively deleterious alleles. Therefore, other source populations with lower abundance of putatively deleterious mutations should be favored as sources of supplementation. We discuss management implications of our results, especially pertaining to the joint identification of neutral and deleterious mutations that could help refining the choice of source and sink populations for supplementation in order to maximize their evolutionary potential and to limit their mutation load.},

  abstract = {Background: Runs of homozygosity are long, uninterrupted stretches of homozygous genotypes that enable reliable estimation of levels of inbreeding (i.e., autozygosity) based on high-throughput, chip-based single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes. While the theoretical definition of runs of homozygosity is straightforward, their empirical identification depends on the type of SNP chip used to obtain the data and on a number of factors, including the number of heterozygous calls allowed to account for genotyping errors. We analyzed how SNP chip density and genotyping errors affect estimates of autozygosity based on runs of homozygosity in three cattle populations, using genotype data from an SNP chip with 777 972 SNPs and a 50 k chip. Results: Data from the 50 k chip led to overestimation of the number of runs of homozygosity that are shorter than 4 Mb, since the analysis could not identify heterozygous SNPs that were present on the denser chip. Conversely, data from the denser chip led to underestimation of the number of runs of homozygosity that were longer than 8 Mb, unless the presence of a small number of heterozygous SNP genotypes was allowed within a run of homozygosity. Conclusions: We have shown that SNP chip density and genotyping errors introduce patterns of bias in the estimation of autozygosity based on runs of homozygosity. SNP chips with 50 000 to 60 000 markers are frequently available for livestock species and their information leads to a conservative prediction of autozygosity from runs of homozygosity longer than 4 Mb. Not allowing heterozygous SNP genotypes to be present in a homozygosity run, as has been advocated for human populations, is not adequate for livestock populations because they have much higher levels of autozygosity and therefore longer runs of homozygosity. When allowing a small number of heterozygous calls, current software does not differentiate between situations where these calls are adjacent and therefore indicative of an actual break of the run versus those where they are scattered across the length of the homozygous segment. Simple graphical tests that are used in this paper are a current, yet tedious solution.},

Individuals from natural populations deal constantly with a diverse range of pathogens and the polymorphism at MHC loci is what determines the diversity of foreign antigens that the host immune system can recognize. Polymorphism at individual loci may result in variable MHC class II (MHC-II) haplotypes. We characterized for the first time, the allelic diversity at the second DRB locus of the MHC-II in the Iberian red deer Cervus elaphus hispanicus. The studied population was sampled from a fenced estate that has been managed for hunting purposes and may provide information of the effect of game management on the genetic diversity of this species. Deer presented high levels of variation at MHC-II DRB-2 with 18 different alleles detected in 94 individuals. However, a significant heterozygous deficiency was found for MHC-II DRB-2 locus (92.5\% of individuals only amplified one allele), whereas genotype frequencies at three neutral microsatellite loci were according to Hardy--Weinberg equilibrium, with heterozygosity over 50\%. The analysis of control Iberian red deer from different geographic locations identified two expressed DRB-2 loci with a high degree of heterozygosis. The annual diversity index of MHC-II DRB-2 alleles significantly decreased along the 16-year study period, which was confirmed with losses in microsatellite markers. Although we cannot exclude positive nonassortative mating and/or substructured breeding (Wahlund effect) within our reference population, such unexpected apparent homozygosity at MHC DRB-2 loci is suggestive of null alleles occurring at our population. The observed pattern could be the result of a founder effect in this recently established population. Nonetheless, the loss of MHC-II DRB-2 allele diversity could reflect the effects of inbreeding in this fenced population managed for hunting. These findings support the importance of immunogenetic studies to assess management decisions, especially in isolated ungulate populations.},

  abstract = {The ubiquitous use of computational work for data generation, processing, and modeling increased the importance of digital documentation in improving research quality and impact. Computational notebooks are files that contain descriptive text, as well as code and its outputs, in a single, dynamic, and visually appealing file that is easier to understand by nonspecialists. Traditionally used by data scientists when producing reports and informing decision-making, the use of this tool in research publication is not common, despite its potential to increase research impact and quality. For a single study, the content of such documentation partially overlaps with that of classical lab notebooks and that of the scientific manuscript reporting the study. Therefore, to minimize the amount of work required to manage all the files related to these contents and optimize their production, we present a starter kit to facilitate the implementation of computational notebooks in the research process, including publication. The kit contains the template of a computational notebook integrated into a research project that employs R, Python, or Julia. Using examples of ecological studies, we show how computational notebooks also foster the implementation of principles of Open Science, such as reproducibility and traceability. The kit is designed for beginners, but at the end we present practices that can be gradually implemented to develop a fully digital research workflow. Our hope is that such minimalist yet effective starter kit will encourage researchers to adopt this practice in their workflow, regardless of their computational background.},

  abstract = {Increasing evidence indicates that non-DNA sequence-based epigenetic information can be inherited across several generations in organisms ranging from yeast to plants to humans. This raises the possibility of heritable `epimutations' contributing to heritable phenotypic variation and thus to evolution. Recent work has shed light on both the signals that underpin these epimutations, including DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNAs, and the mechanisms by which they are transmitted across generations at the molecular level. These mechanisms can vary greatly among species and have a more limited effect in mammals than in plants and other animal species. Nevertheless, common principles are emerging, with transmission occurring either via direct replicative mechanisms or indirect reconstruction of the signal in subsequent generations. As these processes become clearer we continue to improve our understanding of the distinctive features and relative contribution of DNA sequence and epigenetic variation to heritable differences in phenotype.},

  abstract = {Chagas disease is endemic in 22 Latin American countries, with approximately 8 million individuals infected worldwide and 10,000 deaths yearly. Trypanosoma cruzi presents an intracellular life cycle in mammalian hosts to sustain infection. Parasite infection activates host cell responses, promoting an unbalance in reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the intracellular environment inducing genomic DNA lesions in the host cell during infection. To further understand changes in host cell chromatin induced by parasite infection, we investigated alterations in chromatin caused by infection by performing quantitative proteomic analysis. DNA Damage Repair proteins, such as Poly-ADP-ribose Polymerase 1 (PARP-1) and X-Ray Repair Cross Complementing 6 (XRRC6), were recruited to the chromatin during infection. Also, changes in chromatin remodeling enzymes suggest that parasite infection may shape the epigenome of the host cells. Interestingly, the abundance of oxidative phosphorylation mitochondrial and vesicle-mediated transport proteins increased in the host chromatin at the final stages of infection. In addition, Apoptosis-inducing Factor (AIF) is translocated to the host cell nucleus upon infection, suggesting that cells enter parthanatos type of death. Altogether, this study reveals how parasites interfere with the host cells' responses at the chromatin level leading to significant crosstalk that support and disseminate infection.},

Information is based on the analysis of correlation and on multiple regression models. However, these methods are often flawed or unsuitable for conclusive results. By contrast, an explicit model of the breeding behaviour of male fallow deer (Dama dama L.) has been formulated using structural (regression) equations. The model describes with outstanding precision the network of short-term determinants of male copulatory success. Harem size is identified as the most important indirect cause of male copulatory success and, in its turn, it is a function of (i) lek attendance, (ii) intensity of herding, (iii) aggressive behaviour towards other bucks and (iv) courtship. Comparing the results of the structural-equations model with those of a partial correlation analysis and of a multiple regression study, we conclude that the statistical method presented here better describes the complexity of the causal web which characterizes leks than other statistical methods commonly used in these studies.},

We suggest that the physical changes niche constructors make to their environments may also alter trait heritability and the response of phenotypes to selection. This effect might change evolution, over and above the effect of NC acting via selection alone. We develop models of trait evolution that allow us to partition the effects of NC on trait heritability from those on selection to better investigate their distinct effects. We show that the response of a phenotype to selection and so the pace of phenotypic change can be considerably altered in the presence of NC and that this effect is compounded when trans-generational interactions are included. We argue that novel mathematical approaches are needed to describe the simultaneous effects of NC on trait evolution via selection and heritability. Just as indirect genetic effects have been shown to significantly increase trait heritability, the effects of NC on heritability in our model suggest a need for further theoretical development of the concept of heritability.},

  abstract = {Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) were commercially exploited on the subantarctic island of South Georgia for over 100 years and nearly driven to extinction. Since the cessation of harvesting, however, their populations have rebounded, and they are now often considered a nuisance species whose impact on the terrestrial landscape should be mitigated. Any evaluation of their current population requires the context provided by their historic, pre-exploitation abundance, lest ecologists fall prey to shifting baseline syndrome in which their perspective on current abundance is compared only with an altered state resulting from past anthropogenic disturbance. Estimating pre-exploitation abundance is critical to defining species recovery and setting recovery targets, both of which are needed for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's recent efforts to develop a green list of recovering species. To address this issue, we reconstructed the South Georgia fur seal harvest from 1786 to 1908 from ship logbooks and other historical records and interpolated missing harvest data as necessary with a generalized linear model fit to the historical record. Using an approximate Bayesian computation framework, harvest data, and a stochastic age-structured population model, we estimated the pre-exploitation abundance of Antarctic fur seals on South Georgia was 2.5 million females (95\% CI 1.5--3.5 million). This estimate is similar to recent abundance estimates, and suggests current populations, and the ecological consequences of so many fur seals on the island, may be similar to conditions prior to human harvest. Although the historic archive on the fur sealing era is unavoidably patchy, the use of archival records is essential for reconstructing the past and, correspondingly, to understanding the present.},

Length distributions of ROH are informative about population history; specifically, the probability of inbreeding mediated by mating system and/or population demography. Here, we investigated whether variation in killer whale (Orcinus orca) demographic history is reflected in genome-\-wide heterozygosity and ROH length distributions, using a global data set of 26 genomes representative of geographic and ecotypic variation in this species, and two F1 admixed individuals with Pacific-\-Atlantic parentage. We first reconstructed demographic history for each population as changes in effective population size through time using the pairwise sequential Markovian coalescent (PSMC) method. We found a subset of populations declined in effective population size during the Late Pleistocene, while others had more stable demography. Genomes inferred to have undergone ancestral declines in effective population size, were autozygous at hundreds of short ROH ({$<$}1 Mb), reflecting high background relatedness due to coalescence of haplotypes deep within the pedigree. In contrast, longer and therefore younger ROH ({$>$}1.5 Mb) were found in low latitude populations, and populations of known conservation concern. These include a Scottish killer whale, for which 37.8\% of the autosomes were comprised of ROH {$>$}1.5 Mb in length. The fate of this population, in which only two adult males have been sighted in the past five years, and zero fecundity over the last two decades, may be inextricably linked to its demographic history and consequential inbreeding depression.},

  abstract = {In honey bees (               Apis mellifera               ), the development of a larva into either a queen or worker depends on differential feeding with royal jelly and involves epigenomic modifications by DNA methyltransferases. To understand the role of DNA methylation in this process we sequenced the larval methylomes in both queens and workers. We show that the number of differentially methylated genes (DMGs) in larval head is significantly increased relative to adult brain (2,399 vs. 560) with more than 80\% of DMGs up-methylated in worker larvae. Several highly conserved metabolic and signaling pathways are enriched in methylated genes, underscoring the connection between dietary intake and metabolic flux. This includes genes related to juvenile hormone and insulin, two hormones shown previously to regulate caste determination. We also tie methylation data to expressional profiling and describe a distinct role for one of the DMGs encoding anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), an important regulator of metabolism. We show that               alk               is not only differentially methylated and alternatively spliced in               Apis               , but also seems to be regulated by a               cis               -acting, anti-sense non--protein-coding transcript. The unusually complex regulation of ALK in               Apis               suggests that this protein could represent a previously unknown node in a process that activates downstream signaling according to a nutritional context. The correlation between methylation and alternative splicing of               alk               is consistent with the recently described mechanism involving RNA polymerase II pausing.

Using AFLP and methylation-sensitive AFLP, we tested the hypothesis that differentiation to habitats along natural salt marsh environmental gradients occurs at epigenetic, but not genetic loci in two salt marsh perennials. We detected significant genetic and epigenetic structure among populations and among subpopulations, but we found multilocus patterns of differentiation to habitat type only in epigenetic variation for both species. In addition, more epigenetic than genetic loci were correlated with habitat in both species. When we analysed genetic and epigenetic variation simultaneously with partial Mantel, we found no correlation between genetic variation and habitat and a significant correlation between epigenetic variation and habitat in Spartina alterniflora. In Borrichia frutescens, we found significant correlations between epigenetic and/or genetic variation and habitat in four of five populations when populations were analysed individually, but there was no significant correlation between genetic or epigenetic variation and habitat when analysed jointly across the five populations. These analyses suggest that epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the response to salt marsh habitats, but also that the relationships among genetic and epigenetic variation and habitat vary by species. Sitespecific conditions may also cloud our ability to detect response in replicate populations with similar environmental gradients. Future studies analysing sequence data and the correlation between genetic variation and DNA methylation will be powerful to identify the contributions of genetic and epigenetic response to environmental gradients.},

  abstract = {Association studies of polygenic traits are notoriously difficult when those studies are conducted at large geographic scales. The difficulty arises as genotype frequencies often vary in geographic space and across distinct environments. Those large-scale variations are known to yield false positives in standard association testing approaches. Although several methods alleviate this problem, no tools have been proposed to evaluate the power that association tests could achieve for a specific study design and set of genotypes. Our goal here is to present an R program fulfilling this objective, by allowing users to simulate phenotypes from observed genotypes and to estimate upper bounds on achievable power. The simulation model can incorporate realistic features such as population structure and gene-by-environment interactions, and the package implements a gold-standard test that evaluates power using information on confounders. We illustrated the use of the program with example studies based on data for the plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. Simulated phenotypes were used to compare the ability of two recent association methods to correctly remove confounding factors, to evaluate power to detect causal variants, and to assess the influence various parameters. For the simulated data, the new tests reached performances close to the goldstandard test and could be reasonably used with measured phenotypes. Power to detect causal variants was influenced by the number of variants and by the strength of their effect sizes, and specific thresholds were obtained from the simulation study. In conclusion, our program provides guidance on methodological choice of association tests, as well as useful knowledge on test performances in a user-specific context.},

  abstract = {Deleterious alleles may be removed (purged) by natural selection in populations undergoing inbreeding. However, there is controversy regarding the effectiveness of purging in reducing the extinction risk due to inbreeding, particularly in conservation contexts. We evaluated the effects of purging on the extinction risk due to inbreeding in Drosophila melanogaster using two base populations, an outbred population (non-purged) and four-way crosses between highly inbred lines derived from the same population (purged). The inbred lines used in the four-way crosses were previously subjected to 20 generations of full-sib mating. The impact of full-sib inbreeding over a further 12 generations was compared in 200 populations from each of the two base populations. There was a small and non-significant difference between the extinction rates at an inbreeding coefficient of 0.93 in the non-purged (0.74 {\textpm} 0.03) and purged (0.69 {\textpm} 0.03) treatments. This is consistent with other evidence indicating that the effects of purging are often small. Purging using rapid inbreeding in very small populations cannot be relied upon to eliminate the deleterious effects of inbreeding.},

This can reshape sociospatial structure, genetic composition, fitness, and potentially affect evolution. Genetic tools can detect changes in local, fine-scale genetic structure (FGS) and assess the interplay between harvest-caused social and FGS in populations. We used data on 1614 brown bears, Ursus arctos, genotyped with 16 microsatellites, to investigate whether harvest intensity (mean low: 0.13 from 1990 to 2005, mean high: 0.28 from 2006 to 2011) caused changes in FGS among matrilines (8 matrilines; 109 females {$\geq$}4 years of age), sex-specific survival and putative dispersal distances, female spatial genetic autocorrelation, matriline persistence, and male mating patterns. Increased harvest decreased FGS of matrilines. Female dispersal distances decreased, and male reproductive success was redistributed more evenly. Adult males had lower survival during high harvest, suggesting that higher male turnover caused this redistribution and helped explain decreased structure among matrilines, despite shorter female dispersal distances. Adult female survival and survival probability of both mother and daughter were lower during high harvest, indicating that matriline persistence was also lower. Our findings indicate a crucial role of regulated harvest in shaping populations, decreasing differences among ``groups,'' even for solitary-living species, and potentially altering the evolutionary trajectory of wild populations.},

  abstract = {Harvest by means of hunting is a commonly used tool in large carnivore management. To evaluate the effects of harvest on populations, managers usually focus on numerical or immediate direct demographic effects of harvest mortality on a population's size and growth. However, we suggest that managers should also give consideration to indirect and potential evolutionary effects of hunting (e.g., the consequences of a change in the age, sex, and social structure), and their effects on population growth rate. We define ``indirect effects'' as hunting-induced changes in a population, including humaninduced selection, that result in an additive change to the population growth rate ``lambda'' beyond that due to the initial offtake from direct mortality. We considered 4 major sources of possible indirect effects from hunting of bears: (1) changes to a population's age and sex structure, (2) changes to a population's social structure, (3) changes in individual behavior, and (4) human-induced selection. We identified empirically supported, as well as expected, indirect effects of hunting based primarily on {$>$}30 years of research on the Scandinavian brown bear (Ursus arctos) population. We stress that some indirect effects have been documented (e.g., habitat use and daily activity patterns of bears change when hunting seasons start, and changes in male social structure induce sexually selected infanticide and reduce population growth). Other effects may be more difficult to document and quantify in wild bear populations (e.g., how a younger age structure in males may lead to decreased offspring survival). We suggest that managers of bear and other large carnivore populations adopt a precautionary approach and assume that indirect effects do exist, have a potential impact on population structure, and, ultimately, may have an effect on population growth that differs from that predicted by harvest models based on direct effects alone.},

  abstract = {Animal models typically require a known genetic pedigree to estimate quantitative genetic parameters. Here we test whether animal models can alternatively be based on estimates of relatedness derived entirely from molecular marker data. Our case study is the morphology of a wild bird population, for which we report estimates of the genetic variance--covariance matrices (               G               ) of six morphological traits using three methods: the traditional animal model; a molecular marker-based approach to estimate heritability based on Ritland's pairwise regression method; and a new approach using a molecular genealogy arranged in a relatedness matrix (               R               ) to replace the pedigree in an animal model. Using the traditional animal model, we found significant genetic variance for all six traits and positive genetic covariance among traits. The pairwise regression method did not return reliable estimates of quantitative genetic parameters in this population, with estimates of genetic variance and covariance typically being very small or negative. In contrast, we found mixed evidence for the use of the pedigree-free animal model. Similar to the pairwise regression method, the pedigree-free approach performed poorly when the full-rank               R               matrix based on the molecular genealogy was employed. However, performance improved substantially when we reduced the dimensionality of the               R               matrix in order to maximize the signal to noise ratio. Using reduced-rank               R               matrices generated estimates of genetic variance that were much closer to those from the traditional model. Nevertheless, this method was less reliable at estimating covariances, which were often estimated to be negative. Taken together, these results suggest that pedigree-free animal models can recover quantitative genetic information, although the signal remains relatively weak. It remains to be determined whether this problem can be overcome by the use of a more powerful battery of molecular markers and improved methods for reconstructing genealogies.},

The main issues addressed in this paper are: (1) Does genomic imprinting exist in birds? (2) How does the embryonic environment influence the adult phenotype in avian species? (3) Does the embryonic environment have an impact on phenotypic variability across several successive generations? The potential for epigenetic studies to improve the performance of individual animals through the implementation of limited changes in breeding conditions or the addition of new parameters in selection models is still an open question. {\copyright} 2013 Fr{\'e}sard et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Except for parent-offspring dyads, pedigrees capture relatedness imperfectly. The number and length of DNA segments that are identical-by-descent (IBD) yield the most precise estimates of relatedness. Here, we leverage novel methods for estimating locus-specific IBD from low coverage whole genome resequencing data to demonstrate the feasibility and value of resolving fine-scaled gradients of relatedness in free-living animals. Using primarily 4-6{\texttimes} coverage data from a rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) population with available long-term pedigree data, we show that we can call the number and length of IBD segments across the genome with high accuracy even at 0.5{\texttimes} coverage. The resulting estimates demonstrate substantial variation in genetic relatedness within kin classes, leading to overlapping distributions between kin classes. They identify cryptic genetic relatives that are not represented in the pedigree and reveal elevated recombination rates in females relative to males, which allows us to discriminate maternal and paternal kin using genotype data alone. Our findings represent a breakthrough in the ability to understand the predictors and consequences of genetic relatedness in natural populations, contributing to our understanding of a fundamental component of population structure in the wild.},

Members of this family have been shown to act as RNA helicases or unwindases, using the energy from ATP hydrolysis to unwind RNA structures or dissociate RNA--protein complexes in cellular processes that require modulation of RNA structures. However, it is clear that several members of this family are multifunctional and, in addition to acting as RNA helicases in processes such as pre-mRNA processing, play important roles in transcriptional regulation. In this review I shall concentrate on RNA helicase A (Dhx9), DP103 (Ddx20), p68 (Ddx5) and p72 (Ddx17), proteins for which there is a strong body of evidence showing that they play important roles in transcription, often as coactivators or corepressors through their interaction with key components of the transcriptional machinery, such as CREB-binding protein, p300, RNA polymerase II and histone deacetylases.},

  abstract = {Conservation help from genomics                            Corals worldwide are under threat from rising sea temperatures and pollution. One response to heat stress is coral bleaching---the loss of photosynthetic endosymbionts that provide energy for the coral. Fuller               et al.               present a high-resolution genome of the coral               Acropora millepora               (see the Perspective by Bay and Guerrero). They were able to perform population genetic analyses with samples sequenced at lower coverage and conduct genome-wide association studies. These data were combined to generate a polygenic risk score for bleaching that can be used in coral conservation.                                         Science               this issue p.               eaba4674               ; see also p.               249                        ,              A high-quality genome analysis of a branching stony coral helps elucidate the genetics of coral bleaching.           ,                             INTRODUCTION               Coral reefs worldwide are suffering losses at an alarming rate as a result of anthropogenic climate change. Increased seawater temperatures, even only slightly above long-term maxima, can induce bleaching---the breakdown of the symbiotic relationship between coral hosts and their intracellular photosynthetic dinoflagellates from the family Symbiodiniaceae. Because these symbionts provide the majority of energy required by the coral host, prolonged periods of bleaching can eventually lead to the death of the colony. In the face of rapidly increasing temperatures, new conservation strategies are urgently needed to prevent future mass losses of coral cover, and these benefit from an understanding of the genetic basis of bleaching.                                         RATIONALE                                Bleaching responses vary within and among coral species; in the reef-building coral                 Acropora millepora                 , a commonly distributed species across the Indo-Pacific, these differences have been shown to be at least partly heritable. In principle, therefore, interindividual differences in bleaching should be predictable from genomic data. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of using a genomics-based approach to predict individual bleaching responses and suggest ways in which this can inform new strategies for coral conservation.                                                        RESULTS                                We first generated a chromosome-scale genome assembly as well as whole-genome sequences for 237 samples collected at 12 reefs distributed across the central Great Barrier Reef during peak bleaching in 2017. We showed that we can reliably impute genotypes in low-coverage sequencing data with a modestly sized reference haplotype panel, demonstrating a cost-effective approach for future large-scale whole-genome sequencing efforts. Very little population structure was detected across the sampled reefs, which was likely the result of the broadcast spawning mode of reproduction in                 A. millepora                 . Against this genomic background, we detected unusually old variation at the heat-shock co-chaperone                 sacsin                 , which is consistent with long-term balancing selection acting on this gene. Our genomic sequencing approach simultaneously provides a quantitative measure of bleaching and identifies the composition of symbiont species present within individual coral hosts. Testing more than 6.8 million variants for associations with three different measures of bleaching response, no single site reached genome-wide significance, indicating that variation in bleaching response is not due to common loci of large effect. However, a model that incorporates genetic effects estimated from the genome-wide association data, genomic data on relative symbiont species composition, and environmental variables is predictive of individual bleaching phenotypes.                                                        CONCLUSION                                Understanding the genetics of heat and bleaching tolerance will be critical to predict coral adaptation and the future of coral reef ecosystems under climate change. This knowledge also supports both conventional management approaches and the development of new interventions. Our work provides insight into the genetic architecture of bleaching response and serves as a proof of principle for the use of genomic approaches in conservation efforts. We show that a model based on environmental factors, genomic data from the symbiont, and genome-wide association data in the coral host can help distinguish individuals most tolerant to bleaching from those that are most susceptible. These results thus build a foundation toward a genomic predictor of bleaching response in                 A. millepora                 and other coral species.                                                                                       Bleached                     A. millepora                     colonies on the central Great Barrier Reef.                                                           A. millepora                     colonies presenting various severity of bleaching during March 2017 at Feather Reef on the Great Barrier Reef. Colonies with a greater severity of bleaching are those with the most pale colors. Prolonged periods of bleaching can lead to the eventual death of the coral host.                                                                      PHOTO: ERIC MASON/AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF MARINE SCIENCE                                       ,                             Although reef-building corals are declining worldwide, responses to bleaching vary within and across species and are partly heritable. Toward predicting bleaching response from genomic data, we generated a chromosome-scale genome assembly for the coral               Acropora millepora               . We obtained whole-genome sequences for 237 phenotyped samples collected at 12 reefs along the Great Barrier Reef, among which we inferred little population structure. Scanning the genome for evidence of local adaptation, we detected signatures of long-term balancing selection in the heat-shock co-chaperone               sacsin               . We conducted a genome-wide association study of visual bleaching score for 213 samples, incorporating the polygenic score derived from it into a predictive model for bleaching in the wild. These results set the stage for genomics-based approaches in conservation strategies.},

Marine species live in an environment that can provide as much scope for diversification in the vertical as in the horizontal dimension. Understanding the relevant mechanisms will contribute significantly to our understanding of eco-evolutionary processes and effective biodiversity conservation. Here, we provide an annotated genome assembly for the deep-sea fish               Coryphaenoides rupestris               and re-sequencing data to show that differentiation at non-synonymous sites in functional loci distinguishes individuals living at different depths, independent of horizontal spatial distance. Our data indicate disruptive selection at these loci; however, we find no clear evidence for differentiation at neutral loci that may indicate assortative mating. We propose that individuals with distinct genotypes at relevant loci segregate by depth as they mature (supported by survey data), which may be associated with ecotype differentiation linked to distinct phenotypic requirements at different depths.},

Because noncoding variants exert their effects in the context of a gene regulatory network (GRN), we hypothesize that explicit use of disease-relevant GRNs can significantly improve the inference accuracy of noncoding risk variants. We describe Annotation of Regulatory Variants using Integrated Networks (ARVIN), a general computational framework for predicting causal noncoding variants. It employs a set of novel regulatory network-based features, combined with sequence-based features to infer noncoding risk variants. Using known causal variants in gene promoters and enhancers in a number of diseases, we show ARVIN outperforms state-of-the-art methods that use sequence-based features alone. Additional experimental validation using reporter assay further demonstrates the accuracy of ARVIN. Application of ARVIN to seven autoimmune diseases provides a holistic view of the gene subnetwork perturbed by the combinatorial action of the entire set of risk noncoding mutations.},

We found that manuscripts with both initial low or high levels of statistical content increased their statistical content during peer review. The availability of guidelines on statistics in the review forms of journals was associated with an initial similarity of statistical content of manuscripts but did not have any relevant implications on manuscript change during peer review. We found that when reports were more concentrated on statistical content, there was a higher probability that these manuscripts were eventually rejected by editors.},

I present simple analytical equations that predict these consequences, improving and extending a previous heuristic treatment. Purge is defined as the ``extra'' selection induced by inbreeding, due to the ``extra'' fitness disadvantage (2d) of homozygotes for (partially) recessive deleterious alleles. Its effect is accounted for by using, instead of the classical inbreeding coefficient f, a purged inbreeding coefficient g that is weighed by the reduction of the frequency of deleterious alleles caused by purging. When the effective size of a large population is reduced to a smaller stable value N (with Nd {$\geq$} 1), the purged inbreeding coefficient after t generations can be predicted as gt {$\approx$} [(1 -- 1/2N) gt-1 + 1/2N](1 -- 2d ft-1), showing how purging acts upon previously accumulated inbreeding and how its efficiency increases with N. This implies an early fitness decay, followed by some recovery. During this process, the inbreeding depression rate shifts from its ancestral value ({$\delta$}) to that of the mutation--selection--drift balance corresponding to N ({$\delta$}*), and standard selection cancels out the inbreeding depression ascribed to {$\delta$}*. Therefore, purge and inbreeding operate only upon the remaining {$\delta$} - {$\delta$}*. The method is applied to the conservation strategy in which family contributions to the breeding pool are equal and is extended to make use of genealogical information. All these predictions are checked using computer simulation.},

  abstract = {We present a transcriptomic analysis aimed at investigating whether the changes in gene expression that occur under inbreeding generally reduce or enhance inbreeding depression. Discerning between these two alternatives can be addressed only when both changes in expression due to inbreeding and to inbreeding depression are estimated simultaneously. We used Affymetrix 2.0 arrays to study the changes in gene expression associated with both inbreeding and inbreeding depression for fitness in four sets of inbred sublines of Drosophila melanogaster. We found that for most genes showing changes in expression associated with inbreeding, the least depressed sublines were those showing the largest departures in expression from that of the outbred control. This suggests a pattern consistent with a protective role of expression changes against inbreeding effects, and would reveal a new dimension of the transcriptomics of inbreeding. The variation in depression observed could then be due not only to the genetic damages primarily originating that depression, but also possibly to differences in the ability to carry out the appropriate adjustments in gene expression to cope with the inbreeding. We also found that these expression changes with a putative protective role against inbreeding effects show a clear specificity on RNA synthesis and splicing and energy derivation functions.},

  abstract = {Trade-offs and constraints are inherent to life, and studies of these phenomena play a central role in both organismal and evolutionary biology. Trade-offs can be defined, categorized, and studied in at least six, not mutually exclusive, ways. (1) Allocation constraints are caused by a limited resource (e.g., energy, time, space, essential nutrients), such that increasing allocation to one component necessarily requires a decrease in another (if only two components are involved, this is referred to as the Y-model, e.g., energy devoted to size versus number of offspring). (2) Functional conflicts occur when features that enhance performance of one task decrease performance of another (e.g., relative lengths of in-levers and outlevers, force-velocity trade-offs related to muscle fiber type composition). (3) Shared biochemical pathways, often involving integrator molecules (e.g., hormones, neurotransmitters, transcription factors), can simultaneously affect multiple traits, with some effects being beneficial for one or more components of Darwinian fitness (e.g., survival, age at first reproduction, fecundity) and others detrimental. (4) Antagonistic pleiotropy describes genetic variants that increase one component of fitness (or a lower-level trait) while simultaneously decreasing another. (5) Ecological circumstances (or selective regime) may impose trade-offs, such as when foraging behavior increases energy availability yet also decreases survival. (6) Sexual selection may lead to the elaboration of (usually male) secondary sexual characters that improve mating success but handicap survival and/or impose energetic costs that reduce other fitness components. Empirical studies of trade-offs often search for negative correlations between two traits that are the expected outcomes of the trade-offs, but this will generally be inadequate if more than two traits are involved and especially for complex physiological networks of interacting traits. Moreover, trade-offs often occur only in populations that are experiencing harsh environmental conditions or energetic challenges at the extremes of phenotypic distributions, such as among individuals or species that have exceptional athletic abilities. Trade-offs may be (partially) circumvented through various compensatory mechanisms, depending on the timescale involved, ranging from acute to evolutionary. Going forward, a pluralistic view of trade-offs and constraints, combined with integrative analyses that cross levels of biological organization and traditional boundaries among disciplines, will enhance the study of evolutionary organismal biology.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            In polyandrous species, a male's reproductive success depends on his fertilization capability and traits enhancing competitive fertilization success will be under strong, directional selection. This leads to the prediction that these traits should show stronger condition dependence and larger genetic variance than other traits subject to weaker or stabilizing selection. While empirical evidence of condition dependence in postcopulatory traits is increasing, the comparison between sexually selected and `control' traits is often based on untested assumption concerning the different strength of selection acting on these traits. Furthermore, information on selection in the past is essential, as both condition dependence and genetic variance of a trait are likely to be influenced by the pattern of selection acting historically on it. Using the guppy (                                P                 oecilia reticulata                              ), a livebearing fish with high levels of multiple paternity, we performed three independent experiments on three ejaculate quality traits, sperm number, velocity, and size, which have been previously shown to be subject to strong, intermediate, and weak directional postcopulatory selection, respectively. First, we conducted an inbreeding experiment to determine the pattern of selection in the past. Second, we used a diet restriction experiment to estimate their level of condition dependence. Third, we used a half-sib/full-sib mating design to estimate the coefficients of additive genetic variance (               CV               A               ) underlying these traits. Additionally, using a simulated predator evasion test, we showed that both inbreeding and diet restriction significantly reduced condition. According to predictions, sperm number showed higher inbreeding depression, stronger condition dependence, and larger               CV               A               than sperm velocity and sperm size. The lack of significant genetic correlation between sperm number and velocity suggests that the former may respond to selection independently one from other ejaculate quality traits. Finally, the association between sperm number and condition suggests that this trait may mediate the genetic benefits of polyandry which have been shown in this species.},

  abstract = {Life history theory suggests a trade-off between costly activities such as breeding and migration and somatic self-maintenance. However, how the short-term cost of parental effort is expressed in species with a slow pace-of-life is not well understood. Also, investigating carry-over effects of migration is most meaningful when comparing migratory strategies within the same population, but this has rarely been done. We explore this hypothesis in a long-lived, pelagic seabird, the Cory's Shearwater, Calonectris borealis, where males display partial migration. By manipulating reproductive effort and taking advantage of the natural variation in migratory strategy, we investigate whether early reproductive failure and migratory strategy had implications on the physical condition of males on return to the colony the following year. We experimentally induced breeding failure from mid-incubation, tracked the over-winter movements of these males and of males that invested in parental effort, and assessed innate immunity, stress, and residual body mass the following year. Early breeding failure resulted in earlier return to the colony among all males, associated with greater probability of reproductive success. Residents had a lower tail feather fault bar intensity, an indicator of stress during the non-breeding period, compared to migrants. Reproductive effort and migratory strategy had no impact on physiological condition otherwise. Our results provide evidence that in species with a slow-pace of life, such as the Cory's Shearwater, somatic maintenance is prioritised, with the costs of reproduction and migration paid in delayed arrival date.},

The library protocol allows a flexible choice of restriction enzymes and a double digest. The bioinformatics pipeline was integrated in the Snakemake workflow management system, which makes the pipeline easy to execute and modular, and parameter settings for important computational steps flexible. We implemented bismark for alignment and methylation analysis and we preprocessed alignment files by double masking to enable single nucleotide polymorphism calling with Freebayes (epiFreebayes). The performance of several critical steps in epiGBS2 was evaluated against baseline data sets from Arabidopsis thaliana and great tit (Parus major), which confirmed its overall good performance.

Here, we discuss an underestimated third class of genotypic variation: changes in microsatellite and minisatellite repeats. Such tandem repeats (TRs) are ubiquitous, unstable genomic elements that have historically been designated as nonfunctional ``junk DNA'' and are therefore mostly ignored in comparative genomics. However, as many as 10\% to 20\% of eukaryotic genes and promoters contain an unstable repeat tract. Mutations in these repeats often have fascinating phenotypic consequences. For example, changes in unstable repeats located in or near human genes can lead to neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington disease. Apart from their role in disease, variable repeats also confer useful phenotypic variability, including cell surface variability, plasticity in skeletal morphology, and tuning of the circadian rhythm. As such, TRs combine characteristics of genetic and epigenetic changes that may facilitate organismal evolvability.},

  abstract = {The increasing diversity of cultural backgrounds, migration status and age is shaping modern working life. Previous research demonstrated that the attitudes and competences of team members and leaders toward diversity play a crucial role in utilizing the potential of heterogeneous teams and preventing detrimental behavior and discrimination. But even though leaders appear to be key figures in the process of diversity management, their perception of diversity as well as related challenges and chances are poorly investigated. The current paper aims to contribute to the understanding of leaders' perspective on and role in diversity management building on a comparative analysis of two explorative qualitative studies with 16 employees and 22 leaders. The overall research questions are how employees and leaders perceive diversity of culture and age from their specific point of view, which experiences are likely to contribute to their opinion on and perception of diversity and in how far do employees and leaders differ in these aspects. Participants come from the German sector of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), which is the most internationalized and least psychologically investigated sector in Germany. The results show that employees are aware of the topic of diversity in general but have poor competences in dealing with diversity in their daily work life. This seems to be associated with a lack of experience with intercultural interaction and a lack of support from the respective organizations/leaders. We further found that individuals with a migration background do not show any signs of stereotype threat rather than expressing a feeling of being isolated from employees without a migration background. By comparing perspectives of leaders and employees, the current study contributes to the understanding of the processes underlying the experiences of inequalities of migrants and experiences of intercultural miscommunication and faultlines of people without migration background. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

  abstract = {The methylation of cytosines in CpG dinucleotides is essential for cellular differentiation and the progression of many cancers, and it plays an important role in gametic imprinting. To assess variation and inheritance of genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation simultaneously in humans, we applied reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) to somatic DNA from six members of a three-generation family. We observed that 8.1\% of heterozygous SNPs are associated with differential methylation in cis, which provides a robust signature for Mendelian transmission and relatedness. The vast majority of differential methylation between homologous chromosomes ({$>$}92\%) occurs on a particular haplotype as opposed to being associated with the gender of the parent of origin, indicating that genotype affects DNA methylation of far more loci than does gametic imprinting. We found that 75\% of genotype-dependent differential methylation events in the family are also seen in unrelated individuals and that overall genotype can explain 80\% of the variation in DNA methylation. These events are under-represented in CpG islands, enriched in intergenic regions, and located in regions of low evolutionary conservation. Even though they are generally not in functionally constrained regions, 22\% (twice as many as expected by chance) of genes harboring genotype-dependent DNA methylation exhibited allele-specific gene expression as measured by RNA-seq of a lymphoblastoid cell line, indicating that some of these events are associated with gene expression differences. Overall, our results demonstrate that the influence of genotype on patterns of DNA methylation is widespread in the genome and greatly exceeds the influence of imprinting on genome-wide methylation patterns. {\copyright} 2011 Gertz et al.},

  abstract = {A fundamental challenge in the post-genome era is to understand and annotate the consequences of genetic variation, particularly within the context of human tissues. We present a set of integrated experiments that investigate the effects of common genetic variability on DNA methylation and mRNA expression in four human brain regions each from 150 individuals (600 samples total). We find an abundance of genetic cis regulation of mRNA expression and show for the first time abundant quantitative trait loci for DNA CpG methylation across the genome. We show peak enrichment for cis expression QTLs to be approximately 68,000 bp away from individual transcription start sites; however, the peak enrichment for cis CpG methylation QTLs is located much closer, only 45 bp from the CpG site in question. We observe that the largest magnitude quantitative trait loci occur across distinct brain tissues. Our analyses reveal that CpG methylation quantitative trait loci are more likely to occur for CpG sites outside of islands. Lastly, we show that while we can observe individual QTLs that appear to affect both the level of a transcript and a physically close CpG methylation site, these are quite rare. We believe these data, which we have made publicly available, will provide a critical step toward understanding the biological effects of genetic variation.},

In order to gain a greater understanding of epigenetic effects in societies, we investigated DNA methylation in the termite               Zootermopsis nevadensis               . Termites are the most ancient social insects, and developmentally distinct from highly-studied, hymenopteran social insects. We used replicated bisulfite-sequencing to investigate patterns of DNA methylation in both sexes and among castes of               Z. nevadensis.               We discovered that               Z. nevadensis               displayed some of the highest levels of DNA methylation found in insects. We also found strong differences in methylation between castes. Methylated genes tended to be uniformly and highly expressed demonstrating the antiquity of associations between intragenic methylation and gene expression. Differentially methylated genes were more likely to be alternatively spliced than not differentially methylated genes, and possessed considerable enrichment for development-associated functions. We further observed strong overrepresentation of multiple transcription factor binding sites and miRNA profiles associated with differential methylation, providing new insights into the possible function of DNA methylation. Overall, our results show that DNA methylation is widespread and associated with caste differences in termites. More generally, this study provides insights into the function of DNA methylation and the success of insect societies.},

  abstract = {Body size is a key selected trait in many animal systems: larger size is sexually selected for in males because it confers a reproductive advantage during contest competition for access to females, and larger females are naturally selected for fecundity. Herein, we used radio-telemetry to gather a large dataset of male--female interactions and DNA paternity analyses to characterize the intensity of sexual selection and the link between two body size metrics (body length and condition, the latter manipulated experimentally for males) and reproductive success in a population of puff adders               Bitis arietans               . Our multiple estimates of the intensity of sexual selection generally indicated that males experienced stronger sexual selection than females. However, the Bateman gradients did not differ by sex, despite the fact that males increased reproductive success by mating with multiple females while females did not. We also found no strong evidence that females experienced indirect fitness benefits through multiple matings. Body size was not a key predictor of male reproductive success, and for females, body condition -- but not body length -- was the critical fecundity trait. Altogether, a combination of factors suggests that post-copulatory mechanisms of sexual selection (e.g. sperm competition, cryptic female choice) may play critical roles in this mating system and perhaps that of other snakes. We interpret our findings in the context of sexual conflict -- a ubiquitous and potent driver of mating strategy evolution -- to propose a scenario for the evolution of female promiscuity that is applicable to many other animal systems where males roam widely to locate females at high costs.},

  abstract = {Accumulation of deleterious mutations has important consequences for the evolution of mating systems and the persistence of small populations. It is well established that consanguineous mating can purge a part of the mutation load and that lethal mutations can also be purged in small populations. However, the efficiency of purging in natural populations, due to either consanguineous mating or to reduced population size, has been questioned. Consequences of consanguineous mating systems and small population size are often equated under ``inbreeding'' because both increase homozygosity, and selection is though to be more efficient against homozygous deleterious alleles. I show that two processes of purging that I call ``purging by drift'' and ``purging by nonrandom mating'' have to be distinguished. Conditions under which the two ways of purging are effective are derived. Nonrandom mating can purge deleterious mutations regardless of their dominance level, whereas only highly recessive mutations can be purged by drift. Both types of purging are limited by population size, and sharp thresholds separate domains where purging is either effective or not. The limitations derived here on the efficiency of purging are compatible with some experimental studies. Implications of these results for conservation and evolution of mating systems are discussed.},

Food availability can clearly affect species; however, there is considerable variation among studies in whether this effect is evident, and thus a lack of clarity over the generality of the relationship. To understand how decreased food availability due to invertebrate declines will affect bird populations, we conducted a systematic review and used meta-analytic structural equation modelling, which allowed us to treat our core variables of interest as latent variables estimated by the diverse ways in which researchers measure fecundity and chick body condition. We found a moderate positive effect of food availability on chick body condition and a strong positive effect on reproductive success. We also found a negative relationship between chick body condition and reproductive success. Our results demonstrate that food is generally a limiting factor for breeding songbirds. Our analysis also provides evidence for a consistent trade-off between chick body condition and reproductive success, demonstrating the complexity of trophic dynamics important for these vital rates.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Theory predicts that the ability of selection and recombination to purge mutation load is enhanced if selection against deleterious genetic variants operates more strongly in males than females. However, direct empirical support for this tenet is limited, in part because traditional quantitative genetic approaches allow dominance and intermediate-frequency polymorphisms to obscure the effects of the many rare and partially recessive deleterious alleles that make up the main part of a population's mutation load. Here, we exposed the partially recessive genetic load of a population of Callosobruchus maculatus seed beetles via successive generations of inbreeding, and quantified its effects by measuring heterosis---the increase in fitness experienced when masking the effects of deleterious alleles by heterozygosity---in a fully factorial sex-specific diallel cross among 16 inbred strains. Competitive lifetime reproductive success (i.e., fitness) was measured in male and female outcrossed F1s as well as inbred parental ``selfs,'' and we estimated the 4~{\texttimes}~4 male-female inbred-outbred genetic covariance matrix for fitness using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations of a custom-made general linear mixed effects model. We found that heterosis estimated independently in males and females was highly genetically correlated among strains, and that heterosis was strongly negatively genetically correlated to outbred male, but not female, fitness. This suggests that genetic variation for fitness in males, but not in females, reflects the amount of (partially) recessive deleterious alleles segregating at mutation-selection balance in this population. The population's mutation load therefore has greater potential to be purged via selection in males. These findings contribute to our understanding of the prevalence of sexual reproduction in nature and the maintenance of genetic variation in fitness-related traits.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Theory predicts that the ability of selection and recombination to purge mutation load is enhanced if selection against deleterious genetic variants operates more strongly in males than females. However, direct empirical support for this tenet is limited, in part because traditional quantitative genetic approaches allow dominance and intermediate-frequency polymorphisms to obscure the effects of the many rare and partially recessive deleterious alleles that make up the main part of a population's mutation load. Here, we exposed the partially recessive genetic load of a population of Callosobruchus maculatus seed beetles via successive generations of inbreeding, and quantified its effects by measuring heterosis---the increase in fitness experienced when masking the effects of deleterious alleles by heterozygosity---in a fully factorial sex-specific diallel cross among 16 inbred strains. Competitive lifetime reproductive success (i.e., fitness) was measured in male and female outcrossed F1s as well as inbred parental ``selfs,'' and we estimated the 4~{\texttimes}~4 male-female inbred-outbred genetic covariance matrix for fitness using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations of a custom-made general linear mixed effects model. We found that heterosis estimated independently in males and females was highly genetically correlated among strains, and that heterosis was strongly negatively genetically correlated to outbred male, but not female, fitness. This suggests that genetic variation for fitness in males, but not in females, reflects the amount of (partially) recessive deleterious alleles segregating at mutation-selection balance in this population. The population's mutation load therefore has greater potential to be purged via selection in males. These findings contribute to our understanding of the prevalence of sexual reproduction in nature and the maintenance of genetic variation in fitness-related traits.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Theory predicts that sexual reproduction can increase population viability relative to asexual reproduction by allowing sexual selection in males to remove deleterious mutations from the population without large demographic costs. This requires that selection acts more strongly in males than females and that mutations affecting male reproductive success have pleiotropic effects on population productivity, but empirical support for these assumptions is mixed. We used the seed beetle               Callosobruchus maculatus               to implement a three-generation breeding design where we induced mutations via ionizing radiation (               IR               ) in the F               0               generation and measured mutational effects (relative to nonirradiated controls) on an estimate of population productivity in the F               1               and effects on sex-specific competitive lifetime reproductive success (               LRS               ) in the F               2               . Regardless of whether mutations were induced via F               0               males or females, they had strong negative effects on male               LRS               , but a nonsignificant influence on female               LRS               , suggesting that selection is more efficient in removing deleterious alleles in males. Moreover, mutations had seemingly shared effects on population productivity and competitive               LRS               in both sexes. Thus, our results lend support to the hypothesis that strong sexual selection on males can act to remove the mutation load on population viability, thereby offering a benefit to sexual reproduction.},

The resulting bottlenecks have a profound impact on the genetic makeup of a species with unknown consequences for health. A key genetic factor for species survival is the evolution of deleterious mutation load, but how bottleneck strength and mutation load interact lacks empirical evidence. We analyze 60 complete genomes of six ibex species and the domestic goat. We show that historic bottlenecks rather than the current conservation status predict levels of genome-wide variation. By analyzing the exceptionally well-characterized population bottlenecks of the once nearly extinct Alpine ibex, we find genomic evidence of concurrent purging of highly deleterious mutations but accumulation of mildly deleterious mutations. This suggests that recolonization bottlenecks induced both relaxed selection and purging, thus reshaping the landscape of deleterious mutation load. Our findings highlight that even populations of {\textasciitilde}1000 individuals can accumulate mildly deleterious mutations. Conservation efforts should focus on preventing population declines below such levels to ensure long-term survival of species.},

Genetic atlases reveal pervasive pleiotropy, and genome-wide significant loci are often shared across different phenotypes. We introduce genomic structural equation modeling (Genomic SEM), a multivariate method for analyzing the joint genetic architectures of complex traits. Using formal methods for modeling covariance structure, Genomic SEM synthesizes genetic correlations and SNP-heritabilities inferred from GWAS summary statistics of individual traits from samples with varying and unknown degrees of overlap. Genomic SEM can be used to identify variants with effects on general dimensions of cross-trait liability, boost power for discovery, and calculate more predictive polygenic scores. Finally, Genomic SEM can be used to identify loci that cause divergence between traits, aiding the search for what uniquely differentiates highly correlated phenotypes. We demonstrate several applications of Genomic SEM, including a joint analysis of GWAS summary statistics from five genetically correlated psychiatric traits. We identify 27 independent SNPs not previously identified in the univariate GWASs, 5 of which have been reported in other published GWASs of the included traits. Polygenic scores derived from Genomic SEM consistently outperform polygenic scores derived from GWASs of the individual traits. Genomic SEM is flexible, open ended, and allows for continuous innovations in how multivariate genetic architecture is modeled.},

Among non-genetic factors involved in phenotype formation are epigenetic mechanisms. Here we aimed to identify whether relative DNA methylation differences in the nidopallium between groups of individuals are among the non-genetic factors involved in the emergence of differential behavioral patterns in hens. The nidopallium was selected due to its important role in complex cognitive function (i.e., decision making) in birds. Behavioral patterns that spontaneously emerge in hens living in a highly controlled environment were identified with a unique tracking system that recorded their transitions between pen zones. Behavioral activity patterns were characterized through three classification schemes: (i) daily specific features of behavioral routines (Entropy), (ii) daily spatio-temporal activity patterns (Dynamic Time Warping), and (iii) social leading behavior (Leading Index). Unique differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified between behavioral patterns emerging within classification schemes, with entropy having the higher number. Functionally, DTW had double the proportion of affected promoters and half of the distal intergenic regions. Pathway enrichment analysis of DMR-associated genes revealed that Entropy relates mainly to cell cycle checkpoints, Leading Index to mitochondrial function, and DTW to gene expression regulation. Our study suggests that different biological functions within neurons (particularly in the nidopallium) could be responsible for the emergence of distinct behavior patterns and that epigenetic variation within brain tissues would be an important factor to explain behavioral variation.},

Numerous studies have demonstrated inter- or multi-generational effects of changing environment in birds, but very few studies have been published showing epigenetic transgenerational inheritance in these species. In this review, we mention work conducted in parent-to-offspring transmission analyses in bird species, with a focus on the impact of early stressors on behaviour. We then present recent advances in transgenerational epigenetics in birds, which involve germline linked non-Mendelian inheritance, underline the advantages and drawbacks of working on birds in this field and comment on future directions of transgenerational studies in bird species.},

It has long been recognized that large-sample goodness-of-fit tests can sometimes lead to spurious results when the sample size and/or some genotypic frequencies are small. Although a complete enumeration algorithm for the exact test has been proposed, it is not of practical use for loci with more than a few alleles due to the amount of computation required. We propose two algorithms to estimate the significance level for a test of HWP. The algorithms are easily applicable to loci with multiple alleles. Both are remarkably simple and computationally fast. Relative efficiency and merits of the two algorithms are compared. Guidelines regarding their usage are given. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the practicality of the algorithms.},

In this study we provide novel insights into the mechanistic relationships between genetic variation, DNA methylation and transcriptome sequencing data in three different cell-types of the GenCord human population cohort. We find that the association between DNA methylation and gene expression variation among individuals are likely due to different mechanisms from those establishing methylation-expression patterns during differentiation. Furthermore, cell-type differential DNA methylation may delineate a platform in which local inter-individual changes may respond to or act in gene regulation. We show that unlike genetic regulatory variation, DNA methylation alone does not significantly drive allele specific expression. Finally, inferred mechanistic relationships using genetic variation as well as correlations with TF abundance reveal both a passive and active role of DNA methylation to regulatory interactions influencing gene expression.},

  abstract = {During range expansions, organisms can use epigenetic mechanisms to adjust to conditions in novel areas by altering gene expression and enabling phenotypic plasticity. Here, we predicted that the number of CpG sites within the genome, one form of epigenetic potential, would be important for successful range expansions because DNA methylation can modulate gene expression and, consequently, plasticity. We asked how the number of CpG sites and DNA methylation varied across five locations in the {$\sim$}70year-old Kenyan house sparrow (Passer domesticus) range expansion. We found that the number of CpG sites was highest toward the vanguard of the invasion and decreased toward the range core. Analysis suggests that this pattern may have been driven by selection, favoring birds with more CpG sites at the range edge. However, we cannot rule out other processes, including nonrandom gene flow. Additionally, DNA methylation did not change across the range expansion, nor was it more variable. We hypothesize that as new areas are colonized, epigenetic potential may be selectively advantageous early but eventually be replaced by less plastic and perhaps genetically canalized traits as populations adapt to local conditions. Although further work is needed on epigenetic potential, this form (CpG number) appears to be a promising mechanism to investigate as a driver of expansions via capacitated phenotypic plasticity in other natural and anthropogenic range expansions.},

  abstract = {A major goal in evolutionary biology is to understand the genetic basis of adaptive traits. In migratory birds, wing morphology is such a trait. Our previous work on the great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) shows that wing length is highly heritable and under sexually antagonistic selection. Moreover, a quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping analysis detected a pronounced QTL for wing length on chromosome 2, suggesting that wing morphology is partly controlled by genes with large effects. Here, we re-evaluate the genetic basis of wing length in great reed warblers using a genomewide association study (GWAS) approach based on restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) data. We use GWAS models that account for relatedness between individuals and include covariates (sex, age and tarsus length). The resulting association landscape was flat with no peaks on chromosome 2 or elsewhere, which is in line with expectations for polygenic traits. Analysis of the distribution of p-values did not reveal biases, and the inflation factor was low. Effect sizes were however not uniformly distributed on some chromosomes, and the Z chromosome had weaker associations than autosomes. The level of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the population decayed to background levels within c. 1 kbp. There could be several reasons to why our QTL study and GWAS gave contrasting results including differences in how associations are modelled (cosegregation in pedigree vs. LD associations), how covariates are accounted for in the models, type of marker used (multi- vs. biallelic), difference in power or a combination of these. Our study highlights that the genetic architecture even of highly heritable traits is difficult to characterize in wild populations.},

  abstract = {Inbreeding increases homozygosity, exposes genome-wide recessive deleterious alleles and often reduces fitness. The physiological and reproductive consequences of inbreeding may be manifested already during gene regulation, but the degree to which inbreeding influences gene expression is unknown in most organisms, including in birds. To evaluate the pattern of inbreeding-affected gene expression over the genome and in relation to sex, we performed a transcriptome-wide gene expression (10 695 genes) study of brain tissue of 10-day-old inbred and outbred, male and female zebra finches. We found significantly lower gene expression in females compared with males at Z-linked genes, confirming that dosage compensation is incomplete in female birds. However, inbreeding did not affect gene expression at autosomal or sex-linked genes, neither in males nor in females. Analyses of single genes again found a clear sex-biased expression at Z-linked genes, whereas only a single gene was significantly affected by inbreeding. The weak effect of inbreeding on gene expression in zebra finches contrasts to the situation, for example, in               Drosophila               where inbreeding has been found to influence gene expression more generally and at stress-related genes in particular.},

As populations decline, the probability of inbreeding increases, along with the potential for negative effects on individual fitness. Detecting and characterizing runs of homozygosity (ROHs) is a popular strategy for assessing the extent of individual inbreeding present in a population and can also shed light on the genetic mechanisms contributing to inbreeding depression. However, selecting an appropriate program and parameter values for such analyses is often difficult for species of conservation concern, for which little is often known about population demographic histories or few high-quality genomic resources are available. Herein, we analyze simulated and empirical data sets to demonstrate the downstream effects of program selection on ROH inference. We also apply a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the effects of various parameter values on ROH-calling results and demonstrate its utility for parameter value selection. We show that ROH inferences can be biased when sequencing depth and the distribution of ROH length is not interpreted in light of program-specific tendencies. This is particularly important for the management of endangered species, as some program and parameter combinations consistently underestimate inbreeding signals in the genome, substantially undermining conservation initiatives. Based on our conclusions, we suggest using a combination of ROH detection tools and ROH length-specific inferences to generate robust population inferences regarding inbreeding history. We outline these recommendations for ROH estimation at multiple levels of sequencing effort typical of conservation genomics studies.},

However, the effects of this type of management on the demography of the exploited species are not well understood. We used multi-event capture-recapture modelling in a population of captive-bred houbara bustards Chlamydotis undulata translocated into a mixed conservation area in Morocco. The specific management practice of our system (hunting regime varying in time and space) led to a quasi-experimental situation that allowed the differentiation of 'natural' from 'hunting-induced' mortality and movement between areas. The analysis uncovered strong asymmetries in both movement and survival that were not only due to direct hunting effects. Firstly, movement probabilities were higher from the sanctuary to the hunting areas than vice versa, even in years without hunting. Secondly, in addition to a direct effect of hunting on mortality in hunting areas, our results uncovered permanent differences in both areas (even outside the hunting period). Overall, our results were consistent with predictions under a source-sink dynamic model but illustrated that mixed conservation areas should not merely be treated as homogeneous systems with spatially heterogeneous hunting pressure but rather as fully heterogeneous systems. The patterns observed may be related to (1) the choice and design of hunting and sanctuary areas by managers, which might not be neutral with respect to habitat quality, or (2) indirect consequences of hunting via an effect on local growth rate and density.},

  abstract = {Sequencing-based DNA methylation profiling methods are comprehensive and, as accuracy and affordability improve, will increasingly supplant microarrays for genome-scale analyses. Here, four sequencing-based methodologies were applied to biological replicates of human embryonic stem cells to compare their CpG coverage genome-wide and in transposons, resolution, cost, concordance and its relationship with CpG density and genomic context. The two bisulfite methods reached concordance of 82\% for CpG methylation levels and 99\% for non-CpG cytosine methylation levels. Using binary methylation calls, two enrichment methods were 99\% concordant, while regions assessed by all four methods were 97\% concordant. To achieve comprehensive methylome coverage while reducing cost, an approach integrating two complementary methods was examined. The integrative methylome profile along with histone methylation, RNA, and SNP profiles derived from the sequence reads allowed genome-wide assessment of allele-specific epigenetic states, identifying most known imprinted regions and new loci with monoallelic epigenetic marks and monoallelic expression.},

  abstract = {Objective: To assess demographic characteristics and perceptions of female physicians in attendance at a medical conference for women with content focused on growth, resilience, inspiration, and tenacity to better understand major barriers women in medicine face and to find solutions to these barriers. Patients and Methods: A Likert survey was administered to female physicians attending the conference (September 20 to 22, 2018). The survey consisted of demographic data and 4 dimensions that are conducive to women's success in academic medicine: equal access, work-life balance, freedom from gender biases, and supportive leadership. Results: All of the 228 female physicians surveyed during the conference completed the surveys. There were 70 participants (31.5\%) who were in practice for less than 10 years (early career), 111 (50\%) who were in practice for 11 to 20 years (midcareer), and 41 (18.5\%) who had more than 20 years of practice (late career). Whereas participants reported positive support from their supervisors (mean, 0.4 [SD 0.9]; P{$<$}.001), they did not report support in the dimensions of work-life balance (mean, {\`A}0.2 [SD 0.8]; P{$<$}.001) and freedom from gender bias (mean, {\`A}0.3 [SD 0.9]; P{$<$}.001). Conclusion: Female physicians were less likely to feel support for work-life balance and did not report freedom from gender bias in comparison to other dimensions of support. Whereas there was no statistically significant difference between career stage, trends noting that late-career physicians felt less support in all dimensions were observed. Future research should explore a more diverse sample population of women physicians.},

Recognizing such challenges, a team of biomedical scientists and inclusivity educators developed and implemented a pilot training program within an academic health sciences center as an initial step to educate faculty and staff regarding their roles in the promotion of an inclusive academic environment, receptive to all students, including underrepresented students. The 3-h workshop included didactic modules, videos, teaching modules, and active attendee participation. Faculty and staff were presented common terminology and ways to promote the development of an inclusive and diverse academic workforce. Compared with pre-workshop, post-workshop survey results indicated a statistically significant improvement in attendee knowledge of correctly identifying definitions of ``implicit bias,'' ``status leveling,'' ``color-blind racial attitudes,'' ``tokenism,'' and ``failure to differentiate.'' Additionally, by the end of the workshop, participants had a statistically significant increase in self-perceptions regarding the importance of improving diversity and recognizing biases and stereotypes in graduate education, knowing what to say when interacting with people from different cultures, and the ability to acknowledge bias when mentoring students from groups underrepresented in the biomedical field. This preliminary initiative was successful in the introduction of faculty and staff to the importance of fostering an inclusive academic environment and thereby developing a diverse workforce.},

Although previous studies have generally used genetically verified pedigrees to document effects of inbreeding and gene flow, these often fail to capture the whole inbreeding history of the species. By assembling a draft arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) genome and resequencing complete genomes of 23 additional foxes born before and after a well-\-documented immigration event in Scandinavia, we here look into the genomic consequences of inbreeding and genetic rescue. We found a difference in genome-\-wide diversity, with 18\% higher heterozygosity and 81\% lower FROH in immigrant F1 compared to native individuals. However, more distant descendants of immigrants (F2, F3) did not show the same pattern. We also found that foxes with lower inbreeding had higher probability to survive their first year of life. Our results demonstrate the important link between genetic variation and fitness as well as the transient nature of genetic rescue. Moreover, our results have implications in conservation biology as they demonstrate that inbreeding depression can effectively be detected in the wild by a genomic approach.},

Wild populations differing in salinity tolerance revealed differential methylation (pop-DMS) at genes enriched for osmoregulatory processes. A two-generation experiment demonstrated that 62\% of these pop-DMS were noninducible by salinity manipulation, suggesting that they are the result of either direct selection or associated genomic divergence at cis- or trans-regulatory sites. Two-thirds of the remaining inducible pop-DMS increased in similarity to patterns detected in wild populations from corresponding salinities. The level of similarity accentuated over consecutive generations, indicating a mechanism of transgenerational plasticity. While we can attribute natural DNA methylation patterns to the two information channels, their interplay with genomic variation in salinity adaptation is still unresolved.},

  abstract = {Inbreeding, relatedness, and ancestry have traditionally been estimated with pedigree information, however, molecular genomic data can provide more detailed examination of these properties. For example, pedigree information provides estimation of the expected value of these measures but molecular genomic data can estimate the realized values of these measures in individuals. Here, we generate the theoretical distribution of inbreeding, relatedness, and ancestry for the individuals in the pedigree of the Isle Royale wolves, the first examination of such variation in a wild population with a known pedigree. We use the 38 autosomes of the dog genome and their estimated map lengths in our genomic analysis. Although it is known that the remaining wolves are highly inbred, closely related, and descend from only 3 ancestors, our analyses suggest that there is significant variation in the realized inbreeding and relatedness around pedigree expectations. For example, the expected inbreeding in a hypothetical offspring from the 2 remaining wolves is 0.438 but the realized 95\% genomic confidence interval is from 0.311 to 0.565. For individual chromosomes, a substantial proportion of the whole chromosomes are completely identical by descent. This examination provides a background to use when analyzing molecular genomic data for individual levels of inbreeding, relatedness, and ancestry. The level of variation in these measures is a function of the time to the common ancestor(s), the number of chromosomes, and the rate of recombination. In the Isle Royale wolf population, the few generations to a common ancestor results in the high variance in genomic inbreeding.},

This oversight limits the generalizability of research findings and their applicability to clinical practice, in particular for women but also for men. This article describes the rationale for an international set of guidelines to encourage a more systematic approach to the reporting of sex and gender in research across disciplines. Methods: A panel of 13 experts representing nine countries developed the guidelines through a series of teleconferences, conference presentations and a 2-day workshop. An internet survey of 716 journal editors, scientists and other members of the international publishing community was conducted as well as a literature search on sex and gender policies in scientific publishing. Results: The Sex and Gender Equity in Research (SAGER) guidelines are a comprehensive procedure for reporting of sex and gender information in study design, data analyses, results and interpretation of findings. Conclusions: The SAGER guidelines are designed primarily to guide authors in preparing their manuscripts, but they are also useful for editors, as gatekeepers of science, to integrate assessment of sex and gender into all manuscripts as an integral part of the editorial process.},

  abstract = {Dispersal is considered to be a species-specific trait, but intraspecific variation can be high. However, when and how this complex trait starts to differentiate during the divergence of species/lineages is unknown. Here, we studied the differentiation of movement behaviour in a large salamander population (Salamandra salamandra), in which individual adaptations to different habitat conditions drive the genetic divergence of this population into two subpopulations. In this system, salamanders have adapted to the deposition and development of their larvae in ephemeral ponds vs. small first-order streams. In general, the pond habitat is characterized as a spatially and temporally highly unpredictable habitat, while streams provide more stable and predictable conditions for the development of larvae. We analysed the finescale genetic distribution of larvae, and explored whether the adaptation to different larval habitat conditions has in turn also affected dispersal strategies and home range size of adult salamanders. Based on the genetic assignment of adult individuals to their respective larval habitat type, we show that pond-adapted salamanders occupied larger home ranges, displayed long-distance dispersal and had a higher variability of movement types than the stream-adapted individuals. We argue that the differentiation of phenotypically plastic traits such as dispersal and movement characteristics can be a crucial component in the course of adaptation to new habitat conditions, thereby promoting the genetic divergence of populations.},

Using a subjective expected utility framework, I argue that higher writing standards for women are consistent with these stylised facts. A counterfactual analysis suggests that senior female economists may, as a result, write at least 5\% more clearly than they otherwise would. As a final exercise, I show tentative evidence that women adapt to biased treatment in ways that may disguise it as voluntary choice.},

  abstract = {Chicks ( Gallus gallus domesticus ) make a repetitive, high energy `distress' call when stressed. Distress calls are a catch-all response to a range of environmental stressors, and elicit food calling and brooding from hens. Pharmacological and behavioural laboratory studies link expression of this call with negative affective state. As such, there is an a priori expectation that distress calls on farms indicate not only physical, but emotional welfare. Using whole-house recordings on 12 commercial broiler flocks ( n = 25 090--26 510/flock), we show that early life (day 1--4 of placement) distress call rate can be simply and linearly estimated using a single acoustic parameter: spectral entropy. After filtering to remove low-frequency machinery noise, spectral entropy per minute of recording had a correlation of -0.88 with a manual distress call count. In videos collected on days 1--3, age-specific behavioural correlates of distress calling were identified: calling was prevalent (spectral entropy low) when foraging/drinking were high on day 1, but when chicks exhibited thermoregulatory behaviours or were behaviourally asynchronous thereafter. Crucially, spectral entropy was predictive of important commercial and welfare-relevant measures: low median daily spectral entropy predicted low weight gain and high mortality, not only into the next day, but towards the end of production. Further research is required to identify what triggers, and thus could alleviate, distress calling in broiler chicks. However, within the field of precision livestock farming, this work shows the potential for simple descriptors of the overall acoustic environment to be a novel, tractable and real-time `iceberg indicator' of current and future welfare.},

  abstract = {Large carnivores, such as wolves and lynx, are strictly protected by law in most European countries. However, they are still vulnerable due to habitat loss and illegal hunting. The Bohemian Forest Ecosystem lynx population is exemplary as a reintroduced carnivore population in Central Europe. The population expanded rapidly after the reintroduction (phase I) but then declined and stagnated at a low population size (phase II). There is some evidence that illegal hunting might have caused this development, but reliable data on the intensity of illegal hunting is lacking, and hence long-term consequences for the population cannot be assessed. We used a spatiallyexplicit individual-based dispersal and population model to inversely fit mortality probabilities to long-term monitoring data; the model integrated both chance observations and telemetry data, and discriminated between baseline mortality, road mortality and added unknown mortality. During phase I, the estimated added unknown mortality ranged between 3 and 4\%, with an extinction rate {$<$} 5\%; during phase II, the estimated added unknown mortality reached 15--20\%, which would prevent animals from colonizing new habitat patches. The probability of extinction in phase II ranged between 13 and 74\%, thereby reaching a tipping point at which the additional unknown mortality of a few animals could drive the population to extinction. However, when we considered the national parks as fully protected, the extinction probability dropped to {$<$} 1\%. Based on our results, we conclude that the added unknown mortality is most likely explained by illegal hunting and therefore the highest priority for the conservation of the lynx population in the Bohemian Forest Ecosystem should be the prevention of illegal hunting in national parks and their immediate surroundings.},

We combined an empirical dataset of {$>$}3000 red deer genotyped at {$>$}35,000 genome-wide autosomal SNPs and evolutionary simulations to investigate the influence of each of these factors on ROH. We assessed ROH in a focal and comparison population to investigate the effect of population history. We investigated the role of recombination using both a physical map and a genetic linkage map to search for ROH. We found differences in ROH distribution between both populations and map types indicating that population history and local recombination rate have an effect on ROH. Finally, we ran forward genetic simulations with varying population histories, recombination rates and levels of selection, allowing us to further interpret our empirical data. These simulations showed that population history has a greater effect on ROH distribution than either recombination or selection. We further show that selection can cause genomic regions where ROH is common, only when the effective population size (               N               e               ) is large or selection is particularly strong. In populations having undergone a population bottleneck               ,               genetic drift can outweigh the effect of selection. Overall, we conclude that in this population, genetic drift resulting from a historical population bottleneck is most likely to have resulted in the observed ROH distribution, with selection possibly playing a minor role.},

These findings are used to examine three functional hypotheses: territoriality, regulation of social and reproductive dominance, and mating competition/mate attraction. Available data provide little evidence for a territorial function of scent-marking behavior in New World primates. Evidence for a function in the regulation of social and reproductive dominance is ambiguous. The patterns of scent marking found so far (i.e., rates of scent marking according to sex and social or reproductive status, and the spatial distribution of scent marks), and the sparse information on responses to scent marks are consistent with a hypothesized function in intrasexual competition and intersexual mate choice.

  abstract = {Gender inequity in science and academia, especially in senior positions, is a recognised problem. The reasons are poorly understood, but include the persistence of historical gender ratios, discrimination and other factors, including gender-based behavioural differences. We studied participation in a professional context by observing question-asking behaviour at a large international conference with a clear equality code of conduct that prohibited any form of discrimination. Accounting for audience gender ratio, male attendees asked 1.8 questions for each question asked by a female attendee. Amongst only younger researchers, male attendees also asked 1.8 questions per female question, suggesting the pattern cannot be attributed to the temporary problem of demographic inertia. We link our findings to the `chilly' climate for women in STEM, including wider experiences of discrimination likely encountered by women throughout their education and careers. We call for a broader and coordinated approach to understanding and addressing the barriers to women and other under-represented groups. We encourage the scientific community to recognise the context in which these gender differences occur, and evaluate and develop methods to support full participation from all attendees.},

  abstract = {Significance             In animal conflict, the more information individuals have about their social world the better decisions they can make about whom to fight. Determining what animals ``know,'' however, has proved difficult. We reverse-engineer how information about an individual's rank structures their aggression. Applying this method to species from ants to primates, we found that while most groups use simple rules to choose fights some groups used more information-rich patterns. A key result is that these information-rich patterns were not restricted to species thought to be more cognitively sophisticated and that their use varied within species. Our work connects sociality with information, provides possibilities for comparative analyses, and opens avenues to study the relationship between individual decision-making and social outcomes.           ,              Members of a social species need to make appropriate decisions about who, how, and when to interact with others in their group. However, it has been difficult for researchers to detect the inputs to these decisions and, in particular, how much information individuals actually have about their social context. We present a method that can serve as a social assay to quantify how patterns of aggression depend upon information about the ranks of individuals within social dominance hierarchies. Applied to existing data on aggression in 172 social groups across 85 species in 23 orders, it reveals three main patterns of rank-dependent social dominance: the downward heuristic (aggress uniformly against lower-ranked opponents), close competitors (aggress against opponents ranked slightly below self), and bullying (aggress against opponents ranked much lower than self). The majority of the groups (133 groups, 77\%) follow a downward heuristic, but a significant minority (38 groups, 22\%) show more complex social dominance patterns (close competitors or bullying) consistent with higher levels of social information use. These patterns are not phylogenetically constrained and different groups within the same species can use different patterns, suggesting that heuristic use may depend on context and the structuring of aggression by social information should not be considered a fixed characteristic of a species. Our approach provides opportunities to study the use of social information within and across species and the evolution of social complexity and cognition.},

We sequenced 260 modern and 8 historical northern elephant seal nuclear genomes to assess the impact of the population bottleneck on individual northern elephant seals and to better understand their recovery.

Classical bottleneck tests, which exploit the fact that rare alleles are rapidly lost during demographic reduction, yielded ambiguous results. In contrast, a strong signal of recent demographic decline was detected using both Bayesian skyline plots and Approximate Bayesian Computation, the latter also allowing derivation of posterior parameter estimates that were remarkably consistent with historical observations. This was achieved using only contemporary samples, further emphasizing the potential of Bayesian approaches to address important problems in conservation and evolutionary biology.},

  abstract = {Significance             Many studies of wild populations reveal links between heterozygosity and fitness, with relatively heterozygous individuals carrying fewer parasites, living longer and being more attractive to mates. These patterns appear ubiquitous and are often highly significant, but heterozygosity usually accounts for very little of the total variation in fitness. However, most studies analyze only around 10 loci, representing a tiny fraction of the genome. We therefore used high-throughput DNA sequencing to estimate genome-wide heterozygosity based on over 10,000 loci and found it to accurately reflect inbreeding. Applied to wild harbor seals, genome-wide heterozygosity explained almost half of the variation in parasite infection. By implication, a greater proportion of fitness variation could be linked to genotype than previously thought.           ,                             Proxy measures of genome-wide heterozygosity based on approximately 10 microsatellites have been used to uncover heterozygosity fitness correlations (HFCs) for a wealth of important fitness traits in natural populations. However, effect sizes are typically very small and the underlying mechanisms remain contentious, as a handful of markers usually provides little power to detect inbreeding. We therefore used restriction site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing to accurately estimate genome-wide heterozygosity, an approach transferrable to any organism. As a proof of concept, we first RAD sequenced oldfield mice (               Peromyscus polionotus               ) from a known pedigree, finding strong concordance between the inbreeding coefficient and heterozygosity measured at 13,198 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). When applied to a natural population of harbor seals (               Phoca vitulina               ), a weak HFC for parasite infection based on 27 microsatellites strengthened considerably with 14,585 SNPs, the deviance explained by heterozygosity increasing almost fivefold to a remarkable 49\%. These findings arguably provide the strongest evidence to date of an HFC being due to inbreeding depression in a natural population lacking a pedigree. They also suggest that under some circumstances heterozygosity may explain far more variation in fitness than previously envisaged.},

  abstract = {Significance             Many studies of wild populations reveal links between heterozygosity and fitness, with relatively heterozygous individuals carrying fewer parasites, living longer and being more attractive to mates. These patterns appear ubiquitous and are often highly significant, but heterozygosity usually accounts for very little of the total variation in fitness. However, most studies analyze only around 10 loci, representing a tiny fraction of the genome. We therefore used high-throughput DNA sequencing to estimate genome-wide heterozygosity based on over 10,000 loci and found it to accurately reflect inbreeding. Applied to wild harbor seals, genome-wide heterozygosity explained almost half of the variation in parasite infection. By implication, a greater proportion of fitness variation could be linked to genotype than previously thought.           ,                             Proxy measures of genome-wide heterozygosity based on approximately 10 microsatellites have been used to uncover heterozygosity fitness correlations (HFCs) for a wealth of important fitness traits in natural populations. However, effect sizes are typically very small and the underlying mechanisms remain contentious, as a handful of markers usually provides little power to detect inbreeding. We therefore used restriction site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing to accurately estimate genome-wide heterozygosity, an approach transferrable to any organism. As a proof of concept, we first RAD sequenced oldfield mice (               Peromyscus polionotus               ) from a known pedigree, finding strong concordance between the inbreeding coefficient and heterozygosity measured at 13,198 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). When applied to a natural population of harbor seals (               Phoca vitulina               ), a weak HFC for parasite infection based on 27 microsatellites strengthened considerably with 14,585 SNPs, the deviance explained by heterozygosity increasing almost fivefold to a remarkable 49\%. These findings arguably provide the strongest evidence to date of an HFC being due to inbreeding depression in a natural population lacking a pedigree. They also suggest that under some circumstances heterozygosity may explain far more variation in fitness than previously envisaged.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Animal and plant species around the world are being challenged by the deleterious effects of inbreeding, loss of genetic diversity, and maladaptation due to widespread habitat destruction and rapid climate change. In many cases, interventions will likely be needed to safeguard populations and species and to maintain functioning ecosystems. Strategies aimed at initiating, reinstating, or enhancing patterns of gene flow via the deliberate movement of genotypes around the environment are generating growing interest with broad applications in conservation and environmental management. These diverse strategies go by various names ranging from genetic or evolutionary rescue to provenancing and genetic resurrection. Our aim here is to provide some clarification around terminology and to how these strategies are connected and linked to underlying genetic processes. We draw on case studies from the literature and outline mechanisms that underlie how the various strategies aim to increase species fitness and impact the wider community. We argue that understanding mechanisms leading to species decline and community impact is a key to successful implementation of these strategies. We emphasize the need to consider the nature of source and recipient populations, as well as associated risks and trade-offs for the various strategies. This overview highlights where strategies are likely to have potential at population, species, and ecosystem scales, but also where they should probably not be attempted depending on the overall aims of the intervention. We advocate an approach where short- and long-term strategies are integrated into a decision framework that also considers nongenetic aspects of management.},

  abstract = {We describe the results of two studies of parasitic infection in the black grouse (Tetrao tetrix). The first deals with our own observations of lekking black grouse in which the parasite levels of two blood parasites, the protozoan Leucocytozoon lovati and microfilaria, probably produced by a nematode worm Splendidofilaria tuvensis, were scored. We also obtained measures of age, survival, number of copulations, body mass and length of the ornamental tail feathers (the lyre) of the lekking males. The second study analysed the data from Lund (1954) which involved eight gut parasites obtained from birds which were killed. In the first study we found higher levels of infection of Leucocytozoon in adults relative to young birds. Parasites had no effect on male survival and there was no correlation in infection between the two types of parasites. Birds infected with microfilaria had shorter tail ornaments. There was no relationship between parasitic infection and mating success. However, the data indicated that such a trend indeed may exist for Leucocytozoon and the most successful males on the leks were less often infected by Leucocytozoon than other males. Results of the second study showed a negative relationship between parasite load (a combined measure of all parasites) and both ornamental tail feather length and body mass. These observations are compatible with, but not conclusive evidence for, the hypothesis of Hamilton and Zuk (1982) on the evolution of secondary sexual characters, where females choose to mate with genetically resistant males which show their resistance by expressing larger and more showy secondary sexual characters. Alternative explanations for the observed patterns are: females avoid infected males for some immediate benefit; and/or parasite loads are indicators of general stress rather than genetical resistance. Under the latter hypothesis females could mate with more vigorous males for reasons unrelated to parasite resistance.},

In order to aid conservation decisions, the terms Evolutionary Significant Unit (ESU) and Management Unit (MU) have been proposed. An ESU is an independently evolving evolutionary lineage defined by being reciprocally monophyletic for mitochondrial alleles, and which is significantly different from other lineages with regard to nuclear alleles, whereas an MU is operationally defined by only the latter criterion. Using mitochondrial sequences and nuclear microsatellite loci, we failed to find evidence that British black grouse is an ESU. However, British black grouse are sufficiently different from continental black grouse both with respect to mitochondrial and nuclear data to regard them as a separate MU. Furthermore, we present genetic data which suggest that British black grouse presently occur in what are probably three demographically independent units (roughly corresponding to Wales, northern England/southern Scotland and northern Scotland), which are genetically differentiated. The two southern units (Wales and northern England/southern Scotland) have lower genetic diversity and show signs of having lost genetic variability.},

The topics cover different areas such as reproductive biology, mating system and, more recently, conservation genetics. The accumulated evidence shows that in the western part of the range of the species, populations are genetically differentiated. Furthermore, small and isolated populations have lost genetic variation due to increased levels of inbreeding and genetic drift. So far the vast majority of studies have been based on microsatellites. More recent investigations have employed sequence data as well as methods to study quantitative trait variation. These latter studies may aid in resolving the issue of whether local populations show any evidence of being adapted to local conditions. This is an important consideration in conservation biology since it determines the extent to which populations are interchangeable and which populations should be used for restocking if such are considered of value.},

Genetic diversity, measured as observed heterozygosity (HO), expected heterozygosity (HE) and allelic richness, were lower in isolated populations as compared to the other two categories that did not differ amongst one another. These results imply that lowered genetic variability in black grouse populations is negatively affected by population isolation. Our results suggest that the connectivity of small and isolated populations in Western Europe should be improved or else these face an increased risk of extinction due to genetic and demographic stochasticity.},

Second, in an experiment in which dummy females were placed on males'territories, more females were attracted to the territories on days when males were able to copulate with the dummies. This result was not repeated in two other treatments when males were presented with dummies with which they were not able to copulate or with decoys of ducks. This suggeststhat copulation itself makes a male more attractive to females, although several other cues might also have contributed to the responsesobserved in these experiments.},

In the case of the chicken, it has been hypothesized that DNA methylation may play a mechanistic role in the domestication response. By inter-crossing wild-derived red junglefowl with domestic chickens, we mapped quantitative trait loci for hypothalamic methylation (methQTL), gene expression (eQTL) and behaviour. We find large, stable methylation differences, with 6,179 cis and 2,973 trans methQTL identified. Over 46\% of the trans effects were genotypically controlled by five loci, mainly associated with increased methylation in the junglefowl genotype. In a third of eQTL, we find that there is a correlation between gene expression and methylation, while statistical causality analysis reveals multiple instances where methylation is driving gene expression, as well as the reverse. We also show that methylation is correlated with some aspects of behavioural variation in the inter-cross. In conclusion, our data suggest a role for methylation in the regulation of gene expression underlying the domesticated phenotype of the chicken.},

We compared effects of ecologically relevant manipulations of environmental quality (nutrient dilution in the larval diet) and genetic quality (one generation of inbreeding) on male and female morphology, life history and reproductive performance in the neriid fly               Telostylinus angusticollis               . We found that larval diet quality had strong, positive effects on male and female body size, male secondary sexual traits, and aspects of male and female reproductive performance. By contrast, inbreeding had weak effects on most traits, and no trait showed clear and consistent effects of both environmental and genetic quality. Indeed, inbreeding effects on body size and male competitive performance were of opposite sign in rich vs. poor larval diet treatment groups. Our results suggest that environmental quality strongly affects condition, but the effects of genetic quality are subtle and environment-dependent in this species. These findings raise questions about the genetic architecture of condition and the potential for condition-dependent traits to function as signals of genetic quality.},

  abstract = {Abstract             There are two distinct reasons for making comparisons of genetic variation for quantitative characters. The first is to compare evolvabilities, or ability to respond to selection, and the second is to make inferences about the forces that maintain genetic variability. Measures of variation that are standardized by the trait mean, such as the additive genetic coefficient of variation, are appropriate for both purposes. Variation has usually been compared as narrow sense heritabilities, but this is almost always an inappropriate comparative measure of evolvability and variability. Coefficients of variation were calculated from 842 estimates of trait means, variances and heritabilities in the literature. Traits closely related to fitness have higher additive genetic and nongenetic variability by the coefficient of variation criterion than characters under weak selection. This is the reverse of the accepted conclusion based on comparisons of heritability. The low heritability of fitness components is best explained by their high residual variation. The high additive genetic and residual variability of fitness traits might be explained by the great number of genetic and environmental events they are affected by, or by a lack of stabilizing selection to reduce their phenotypic variance. Over one-third of the quantitative genetics papers reviewed did not report trait means or variances. Researchers should always report these statistics, so that measures of variation appropriate to a variety of situations may be calculated.},

  abstract = {Background: A central aim for studying runs of homozygosity (ROHs) in genome-wide SNP data is to detect the effects of autozygosity (stretches of the two homologous chromosomes within the same individual that are identical by descent) on phenotypes. However, it is unknown which current ROH detection program, and which set of parameters within a given program, is optimal for differentiating ROHs that are truly autozygous from ROHs that are homozygous at the marker level but vary at unmeasured variants between the markers. Method: We simulated 120 Mb of sequence data in order to know the true state of autozygosity. We then extracted common variants from this sequence to mimic the properties of SNP platforms and performed ROH analyses using three popular ROH detection programs, PLINK, GERMLINE, and BEAGLE. We varied detection thresholds for each program (e.g., prior probabilities, lengths of ROHs) to understand their effects on detecting known autozygosity. Results: Within the optimal thresholds for each program, PLINK outperformed GERMLINE and BEAGLE in detecting autozygosity from distant common ancestors. PLINK's sliding window algorithm worked best when using SNP data pruned for linkage disequilibrium (LD). Conclusion: Our results provide both general and specific recommendations for maximizing autozygosity detection in genome-wide SNP data, and should apply equally well to research on whole-genome autozygosity burden or to research on whether specific autozygous regions are predictive using association mapping methods.},

  abstract = {Introduction Growth traits are important in poultry production, however, little is known for its regulatory mechanism at epigenetic level. Therefore, in this study, we aim to compare DNA methylation profiles between fast- and slow-growing broilers in order to identify candidate genes for chicken growth. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation-sequencing (MeDIP-seq) was used to investigate the genome-wide DNA methylation pattern in high and low tails of Recessive White Rock (WRRh; WRRl) and that of Xinhua Chickens (XHh; XHl) at 7 weeks of age. The results showed that the average methylation density was the lowest in CGIs followed by promoters. Within the gene body, the methylation density of introns was higher than that of UTRs and exons. Moreover, different methylation levels were observed in different repeat types with the highest in LINE/CR1. Methylated CGIs were prominently distributed in the intergenic regions and were enriched in the size ranging 200--300 bp. In total 13,294 methylated genes were found in four samples, including 4,085 differentially methylated genes of WRRh Vs. WRRl, 5,599 of XHh Vs. XHl, 4,204 of WRRh Vs. XHh, as well as 7,301 of WRRl Vs. XHl. Moreover, 132 differentially methylated genes related to growth and metabolism were observed in both inner contrasts (WRRh Vs. WRRl and XHh Vs. XHl), whereas 129 differentially methylated genes related to growth and metabolism were found in both across-breed contrasts (WRRh Vs. XHh and WRRl Vs. XHl). Further analysis showed that overall 75 genes exhibited altered DNA methylation in all four contrasts, which included some well-known growth factors of IGF1R, FGF12, FGF14, FGF18, FGFR2, and FGFR3. In addition, we validate the MeDIP-seq results by bisulfite sequencing in some regions. Conclusions This study revealed the global DNA methylation pattern of chicken muscle, and identified candidate genes that potentially regulate muscle development at 7 weeks of age at methylation level.},

To date, few studies have explored the heritability of intergenerationally stable methylation levels in natural populations, and little is known about the relative contribution of cis- and trans-regulatory changes to methylation variation. Here, we explore the heritability of DNA methylation, and conduct methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs) analysis to investigate the genetic architecture underlying methylation variation between marine and freshwater ecotypes of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We quantitatively measured genome-wide DNA methylation in fin tissue using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing of F1 and F2 crosses, and their marine and freshwater source populations. We identified cytosines (CpG sites) that exhibited stable methylation levels across generations. We found that additive genetic variance explained an average of 24--35\% of the methylation variance, with a number of CpG sites possibly autonomous from genetic control. We also detected both cis- and trans-meQTLs, with only trans-meQTLs overlapping with previously identified genomic regions of high differentiation between marine and freshwater ecotypes. Finally, we identified the genetic architecture underlying two key CpG sites that were differentially methylated between ecotypes. These findings demonstrate a potential role for DNA methylation in facilitating adaptation to divergent environments and improve our understanding of the heritable basis of population epigenomic variation.},

  abstract = {Significance             Inbreeding depression is the decrease in fitness with increased genome-wide homozygosity that occurs in the offspring of related parents. Estimation of its effect in wild populations has been challenging, and while evidence of inbreeding depression in juvenile traits is widespread, examples during later life stages remain rare. Here, in a species with extended maternal care, genomic inbreeding coefficients, but not pedigree-based ones, revealed inbreeding depression in annual breeding success in both sexes, and in offspring rearing success in females. This contributed to inbreeding depression in estimates of lifetime fitness in both sexes. Our work illustrates that inbreeding depression in adult traits can be as large as in juvenile traits but requires more powerful methods to be detected.           ,                             Inbreeding depression is of major concern for the conservation of threatened species, and inbreeding avoidance is thought to be a key driver in the evolution of mating systems. However, the estimation of individual inbreeding coefficients in natural populations has been challenging, and, consequently, the full effect of inbreeding on fitness remains unclear. Genomic inbreeding coefficients may resolve the long-standing paucity of data on inbreeding depression in adult traits and total fitness. Here we investigate inbreeding depression in a range of life history traits and fitness in a wild population of red deer (               Cervus elaphus               ) in Scotland using individual inbreeding coefficients derived from dense Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data (                                                                                               F                                                g                         r                         m                                                                                                              ).

We also confirm previous findings of inbreeding depression in birth weight and juvenile survival. In contrast, inbreeding coefficients calculated from a deep and comparatively complete pedigree detected inbreeding depression in juvenile survival, but not in any adult fitness component. The total effect of inbreeding on lifetime breeding success (LBS) was substantial in both sexes: for                                                                                               F                                                g                         r                         m                                                                                                                                                                       =                     0.125                                                                  , a value resulting from a half-sib mating, LBS declined by 72\% for females and 95\% for males.

However, despite being widely used in studies of humans and domesticated plants and animals, SNP arrays are lacking for most wild organisms. We developed a custom 85K Affymetrix Axiom array for an intensively studied pinniped, the Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella). SNPs were discovered from a combination of genomic and transcriptomic resources and filtered according to strict criteria. Out of a total of 85,359 SNPs tiled on the array, 75,601 (88.6\%) successfully converted and were polymorphic in 270 animals from a breeding colony at Bird Island in South Georgia. Evidence was found for inbreeding, with three genomic inbreeding coefficients being strongly intercorrelated and the proportion of the genome in runs of homozygosity being non-zero in all individuals. Furthermore, analysis of genomic relatedness coefficients identified previously unknown first-degree relatives and multiple second-degree relatives among a sample of ostensibly unrelated individuals. Such ``cryptic relatedness'' within fur seal breeding colonies may increase the likelihood of consanguineous matings and could therefore have implications for understanding fitness variation and mate choice. Finally, we demonstrate the cross-amplification potential of the array in three related pinniped species. Overall, our SNP array will facilitate future studies of Antarctic fur seals and has the potential to serve as a more general resource for the wider pinniped research community.},

Genetic management has therefore become a vital tool for ensuring population viability. However, little is known about how the type and intensity of intervention shape the genomic landscape of inbreeding and mutation load. We address this using whole-genome sequence data of the scimitar-horned oryx (               Oryx dammah               ), an iconic antelope that has been subject to contrasting management strategies since it was declared extinct in the wild. We show that unmanaged populations are enriched for long runs of homozygosity (ROH) and have significantly higher inbreeding coefficients than managed populations. Additionally, despite the total number of deleterious alleles being similar across management strategies, the burden of homozygous deleterious genotypes was consistently higher in unmanaged groups. These findings emphasize the risks associated with deleterious mutations through multiple generations of inbreeding. As wildlife management strategies continue to diversify, our study reinforces the importance of maintaining genome-wide variation in vulnerable populations and has direct implications for one of the largest reintroduction attempts in the world.},

As vertebrates, fish share a number of features with the birds and mammals that are more commonly farmed, so many welfare principles derived from consideration of these groups may also be applied to fish. However, fish have a long, separate evolutionary history and are also adapted to a very different, aquatic environment. For these reasons, they have a number of special features that are relevant to how welfare is defined, assessed and promoted and these are discussed. The various methods that are available to researchers for identifying and assessing good and bad welfare in fish are considered, including assessment of physical health and physiological, behavioural and genomic status. The subset of practical welfare indicators that can be used on working farms is also reviewed. Various aspects of intensive aquaculture that can potentially compromise fish welfare are outlined, as are some strategies available for mitigating such adverse effects. Finally, the paper ends by looking briefly to the future, identifying likely changes in aquaculture practices and how these might affect the welfare of farmed fish.},

  abstract = {Advocates of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) have promoted its use in scientific research, impact assessment, and ecological understanding. While several examples illustrate the utility of applying TEK in these contexts, wider application of TEKderived information remains elusive. In part, this is due to continued inertia in favor of established scientific practices and the need to describe TEK in Western scientific terms. In part, it is also due to the difficulty of accessing TEK, which is rarely written down and must in most cases be documented as a project on its own prior to its incorporation into another scientific undertaking. This formidable practical obstacle is exacerbated by the need to use social science methods to gather biological data, so that TEK research and application becomes a multidisciplinary undertaking. By examining case studies involving bowhead whales, beluga whales, and herring, this paper describes some of the benefits of using TEK in scientific and management contexts. It also reviews some of the methods that are available to do so, including semi-directive interviews, questionnaires, facilitated workshops, and collaborative field projects.},

  abstract = {Phenotypic trade-offs are inevitable in nature, but the mechanisms driving them are poorly understood. Movement and oxygen are essential to all animals, and as such, the common ancestor to all living animals passed on mechanisms to acquire oxygen and contract muscle, sometimes at the expense of other activities or expression of traits. Nevertheless, convergent pathways have also evolved to deal with critical trade-offs that are necessary to survive ubiquitous environmental challenges. We discuss how whole-animal performance traits, such as locomotion, are important to fitness, yet costly, resulting in trade-offs with other aspects of the phenotype via specific conserved and convergent mechanistic pathways across all animals. Specifically, we discuss conserved pathways involved in muscle structure and signaling, insulin/insulin-like signaling, sirtuins, mitochondria and hypoxia-inducible factors, as well as convergent pathways involved in energy regulation, development, reproductive investment and energy storage. The details of these mechanisms are only known from a few model systems, and more comparative studies are needed. We make two main recommendations as a framework for future studies of animal form and function. First, studies of performance should consider the broader life-history context of the organism, and vice versa, as performance expression can require a large portion of acquired resources. Second, studies of life histories or mechanistic pathways that measure performance should do so in meaningful and standardized ways. Understanding proximate mechanisms of phenotypic trade-offs will not only better explain the phenotypes of the organisms we study, but also allow predictions about phenotypic variation at the evolutionary scale.},

Here, we use genome-wide association mapping using a custom 50 k single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array in a natural population of collared flycatchers to examine the genetic basis of clutch size, an important life-history trait in many animal species. We found evidence for an association on chromosome 18 where one SNP significant at the genome-wide level explained 3.9\% of the phenotypic variance. We also detected two suggestive quantitative trait loci (QTLs) on chromosomes 9 and 26. Fitness differences among genotypes were generally weak and not significant, although there was some indication of a sex-by-genotype interaction for lifetime reproductive success at the suggestive QTL on chromosome 26. This implies that sexual antagonism may play a role in maintaining genetic variation at this QTL. Our findings provide candidate regions for a classic avian life-history trait that will be useful for future studies examining the molecular and cellular function of, as well as evolutionary mechanisms operating at, these loci.},

Despite the fact that members of this protein family were shown or predicted to be DNA, RNA or protein methyltransferases, most METTL proteins are still poorly characterized. Identification of complexes in which these potential enzymes act could help to understand their function(s) and substrate specificities. Here we systematically studied interacting partners of METTL protein family members in HeLa cells using label-free quantitative mass spectrometry. We found that, surprisingly, many of the METTL proteins appear to function outside of stable complexes whereas others including METTL7B, METTL8 and METTL9 have high-confidence interaction partners. Our study is the first systematic and comprehensive overview of the interactome of METTL protein family that can provide a crucial resource for further studies of these potential novel methyltransferases.},

While intensified land-use is assumed to be the underlying cause of these declines, the mechanisms are not yet understood. Predation is the proximate cause of mortality of eggs, chicks and adults throughout capercaillie and black grouse ranges, but the link between predation and habitat and/or climate change remains unclear. To investigate temporal trends in reproductive output of woodland grouse, we collated previously published and unpublished data of reproduction in capercaillie and black grouse throughout their ranges from 1930 to 2012. We show that, overall, reproductive success has decreased and stabilized at low levels in most regions whilst capercaillie reproductive output in Scotland is still declining. With today's net reproduction, capercaillie and black grouse adult survival is too low to compensate for reproduction declines. Consequently, populations are expected to further decline unless reproductive performances improve. We put our findings in the context of changes in land use, climate and generalist predator numbers. By critically reviewing how these factors limit reproductive success in capercaillie and black grouse, we hope to shed light on the underlying mechanisms causing the decline. Our results imply that measures should be undertaken to reduce mortality of capercaillie and black grouse chicks and eggs. We suggest that future studies should aim to better understand which predators limit capercaillie and black grouse populations and how predation rates are mediated by continuously changing habitat and climate.},

  abstract = {Understanding the genetic architecture underpinning quantitative traits in wild populations is pivotal to understanding the processes behind trait evolution. The `animal model' is a popular method for estimating quantitative genetic parameters such as heritability and genetic correlation and involves fitting an estimate of relatedness between individuals in the study population. Genotypes at genome-\-wide markers can be used to estimate relatedness; however, relatedness estimates vary with marker density, potentially affecting results. Increasing density of markers is also expected to increase the power to detect quantitative trait loci (QTL). In order to understand how the density of genetic markers affects the results of quantitative genetic analyses, we estimated heritability and performed genome-\-wide association studies (GWAS) on five body size traits in an unmanaged population of Soay sheep using two different SNP densities: a dataset of 37,037 genotyped SNPs and an imputed dataset of 417,373 SNPs. Heritability estimates did not differ between the two SNP densities, but the high-\-density imputed SNP dataset revealed four new SNP-\-trait associations that were not found with the lower density dataset, as well as confirming all previously-\-found QTL. We also demonstrated that fitting fixed and random effects in the same step as performing GWAS is a more powerful approach than pre-\-correcting for covariates in a separate model.},

  abstract = {The number of individuals translocated and released as part of a reintroduction is often small, as is the final established population, because the reintroduction site is typically small. Small founder and small resulting populations can result in population bottlenecks, which are associated with increased rates of inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity, both of which can affect the long-term viability of reintroduced populations. I used information derived from pedigrees of four monogamous bird species reintroduced onto two different islands (220 and 259 ha) in New Zealand to compare the pattern of inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity among the reintroduced populations. Although reintroduced populations founded with few individuals had higher levels of inbreeding, as predicted, other factors, including biased sex ratio and skewed breeding success, contributed to high levels of inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity. Of the 10--58 individuals released, 4--25 genetic founders contributed at least one living descendent and yielded approximately 3--11 founder--genome equivalents (number of genetic founders assuming an equal contribution of offspring and no random loss of alleles across generations) after seven breeding seasons. This range is much lower than the 20 founder--genome equivalents recommended for captive-bred populations. Although the level of inbreeding in one reintroduced population initially reached three times that of a closely related species, the long-term estimated rate of inbreeding of this one population was approximately one-third that of the other species due to differences in carrying capacities of the respective reintroduction sites. The increasing number of reintroductions to suitable areas that are smaller than those I examined here suggests that it might be useful to develop long-term strategies and guidelines for reintroduction programs, which would minimize inbreeding and maintain genetic diversity.},

  abstract = {Reintroductions of threatened species are increasingly common in conservation. The translocation of a small subset of individuals from a genetically diverse source population could potentially lead to substantial inbreeding depression due to the high genetic load of the parent population. We analysed 12 years of data from the reintroduced population of North Island robins Petroica longipes on Tiritiri Matangi Island, New Zealand, to determine the frequency of inbreeding and magnitude of inbreeding depression. The initial breeding population consisted of 12 females and 21 males, which came from a large mainland population of robins. The frequency of mating between relatives (f40; 39\%, n =82 pairs) and close relatives (f = 0.25; 6.1\%) and the average level of inbreeding (f = 0.027) were within the range reported for other small island populations of birds. The average level of inbreeding fluctuated from year to year depending on the frequency of close inbreeding (e.g. sib--sib pairs). We found evidence for inbreeding depression in juvenile survival, with survival probability estimated to decline from 31\% among non-inbred birds (f = 0) to 11\% in highly inbred juveniles (f= 0.25). The estimated number of lethal equivalents based on this relationship (4.14) was moderate compared with values reported for other island populations of passerines. Given that significant loss of fitness was only evident in highly inbred individuals, and such individuals were relatively rare once the population expanded above 30 pairs, we conclude that inbreeding depression should have little influence on this robin population. Although the future fitness consequences of any loss of genetic variation due to inbreeding are uncertain, the immediate impact of inbreeding depression is likely to be low in any reintroduced population that expands relatively quickly after establishment.},

  abstract = {Emerging evidence suggests that epigenetic-based mechanisms contribute to various aspects of sex differences in brain and behavior. The major obstacle in establishing and fully understanding this linkage is identifying the traits that are most susceptible to epigenetic modification. We have proposed that sexual selection provides a conceptual framework for identifying such traits. These are traits involved in intrasexual competition for mates and intersexual choice of mating partners and generally entail a combination of male--male competition and female choice. These behaviors are programmed during early embryonic and postnatal development, particularly during the transition from the juvenile to adult periods, by exposure of the brain to steroid hormones, including estradiol and testosterone. We evaluate the evidence that endocrine-disrupting compounds, including bisphenol A, can interfere with the vital epigenetic and gene expression pathways and with the elaboration of sexually selected traits with epigenetic mechanisms presumably governing the expression of these traits. Finally, we review the evidence to suggest that these steroid hormones can induce a variety of epigenetic changes in the brain, including the extent of DNA methylation, histone protein alterations, and even alterations of noncoding RNA, and that many of the changes differ between males and females. Although much previous attention has focused on primary sex differences in reproductive behaviors, such as male mounting and female lordosis, we outline why secondary sex differences related to competition and mate choice might also trace their origins back to steroid-induced epigenetic programming in disparate regions of the brain.},

Currently, it is intensively hunted in the Belarussian part of BPF and protected in the Polish part. We used a combination of molecular analysis, radiotracking, and field observation to study genetic diversity of the population after natural recolonisation and the consequences of heavy hunting for the genetic composition and social structure of wolf packs. Both microsatellite and mtDNA analyses revealed high genetic diversity. For 29 individuals and 20 microsatellite loci, the mean expected heterozygosity was 0.733. Four mtDNA haplotypes were found. Three of them had earlier been described from Europe. Their geographic distribution suggests that wolves recolonising BPF immigrated mainly from the north-east, and less effectively from the east and south-east. We traced the composition of 6 packs for a total of 26 pack-years. Packs were family units (a breeding pair with offspring) with occasional adoption of unrelated adult males, which occurred more frequently in packs living in the Belarussian part of the BPF, due to heavy hunting and poaching. Breeding pairs were half-sibs or unrelated wolves. Pair-bonds in the breeding pair lasted from 1 to 4 years and usually broke by the death of one or both mates. Successors of breeding females were their daughters, while a successor of a breeding male could be either his son or an alien wolf. As is evident from Bia{\textbackslash}lowie{\textbackslash}.za's wolves, high genetic diversity may result from immigration of outside individuals, which are easily recruited to a heavily exploited local population.},

We assessed the trophy size, quota utilization, and distribution of kill sites of African elephant, Cape buffalo, greater kudu, and leopard for the period 2007-2014 in Malapati Safari Area, southeast Zimbabwe. Trophy sizes for African elephant significantly increased over time albeit being below the expected minimum Safari Club International (SCI) score. Cape buffalo trophy sizes declined significantly over time but were not different from the SCI minimum score. However, greater kudu trophy sizes were higher than the SCI minimum score despite being constant over time. Leopard trophy sizes were higher than the SCI minimum score and increased with time. Quota utilization for African elephant and Cape buffalo increased while that of greater kudu and leopard did not change between 2007 and 2014. Some kill sites, in particular, for the African elephant and Cape buffalo, were within the buffer area with the state protected area, i.e., Gonarezhou National Park. Increased hunting pressure likely leads to poor trophy quality and hunting within the protected buffer areas. In contrast, effective adherence to hunting ethics and scientifically and conservatively set quotas largely does not compromise the trophy quality of harvested species. The observed trophy size patterns and kill sites distribution suggest the possible existence of source and sink dynamics of trophy species occurring in a protected area complex within the Zimbabwe's component of the Greater Limpopo Transfrontier Park. To ensure sustainable trophy hunting in the study area and similar ecosystems the following are recommended: (i) scientifically robust, adaptable, and participatory quota setting process, (ii) enhanced adherence to good practice in terms of ethical hunting conduct, and (iii) development of a robust hunting monitoring system covering all elements of hunting for adaptive wildlife management.},

  abstract = {Estimates of genetic components are important for our understanding of how individual characteristics are transferred between generations. We show that the level of heritability varies between 0.12 and 0.68 in six morphological traits in house sparrows (Passer domesticus L.) in northern Norway. Positive and negative genetic correlations were present among traits, suggesting evolutionary constraints on the evolution of some of these characters. A sexual difference in the amount of heritable genetic variation was found in tarsus length, wing length, bill depth and body condition index, with generally higher heritability in females. In addition, the structure of the genetic variance-covariance matrix for the traits differed between the sexes. Genetic correlations between males and females for the morphological traits were however large and not significantly different from one, indicating that sexspecific responses to selection will be influenced by intersexual differences in selection differentials. Despite this, some traits had heritability above 0.1 in females, even after conditioning on the additive genetic covariance between sexes and the additive genetic variances in males. Moreover, a meta-analysis indicated that higher heritability in females than in males may be common in birds. Thus, this indicates sexual differences in the genetic architecture of birds. Consequently, as in house sparrows, the evolutionary responses to selection will often be larger in females than males. Hence, our results suggest that sex-specific additive genetic variances and covariances, although ignored in most studies, should be included when making predictions of evolutionary changes from standard quantitative genetic models.},

It is now clear that animal genomes are regulated to a large extent as a result of input from environmental events and experiences, which cause short- and long-term modifications in epigenetic markings of DNA and histones. In this review, the evidence that such epigenetic modifications can affect the behaviour of animals is explored, and whether such acquired behaviour alterations can transfer across generation borders. First, the mechanisms by which experiences cause epigenetic modifications are examined. This includes, for example, methylation of cytosine in CpG positions and acetylation of histones, and studies showing that this can be modified by early experiences. Secondly, the evidence that specific modifications in the epigenome can be the cause of behaviour variation is reviewed. Thirdly, the extent to which this phenotypically active epigenetic variants can be inherited either through the germline or through reoccurring environmental conditions is examined. A particularly interesting observation is that epigenetic modifications are often linked to stress, and may possibly be mediated by steroid effects. Finally, the idea that transgenerationally stable epigenetic variants may serve as substrates for natural selection is explored, and it is speculated that they may even predispose for directed, non-random mutations. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Here, we used whole-genome sequencing data to assess the genetic status of peripheral populations of the wels catfish (Silurus glanis), and discuss the results in light of a recent microsatellite study of the same populations. The Swedish populations of the wels catfish have suffered from severe declines during the last centuries and persists in only a few isolated water systems. Fragmented populations generally are at greater risk of extinction, for example due to loss of genetic diversity, and may thus require conservation actions. We sequenced individuals from the three remaining native populations (B{\aa}ven, Em{\aa}n, and M{\"o}ckeln) and one reintroduced population of admixed origin (Helge {\aa}), and found that genetic diversity was highest in Em{\aa}n but low overall, with strong differentiation among the populations. No signature of recent inbreeding was found, but a considerable number of short runs of homozygosity were present in all populations, likely linked to historically small population sizes and bottleneck events. Genetic substructure within any of the native populations was at best weak. Individuals from the admixed population Helge {\aa} shared most genetic ancestry with the B{\aa}ven population (72\%). Our results are largely in agreement with the microsatellite study, and stresses the need to protect these isolated populations at the northern edge of the distribution of the species.},

Adverse environmental conditions during early life (large natal brood size) or adulthood (high foraging costs) exert multiple long-term phenotypic effects in zebra finches, and we here test for effects of these manipulations on DNA methylation and expression of the               Nr3c1               gene in blood. Having been reared in a large brood induced higher DNA methylation of the               Nr3c1               regulatory region in adulthood, and this effect persisted over years.               Nr3c1               expression was negatively correlated with methylation at 2 out of 8 CpG sites, and was lower in hard foraging conditions, despite foraging conditions having no effect on               Nr3c1               methylation at our target region.               Nr3c1               expression also correlated with glucocorticoid traits: higher expression level was associated with lower plasma baseline corticosterone concentrations and enhanced corticosterone reactivity. Our results suggest that methylation of the               Nr3c1               regulatory region can contribute to the mechanisms underlying the emergence of long-term effects of developmental conditions in birds, but in our system current adversity dominated over early life experiences with respect to receptor expression.},

We compared patterns of global gene expression (Tag-seq) and gene body methylation (reduced representation bisulfite sequencing) in 80 eastern oysters                     Crassostrea virginica                     from six full-sib families, common gardened for 14~months at two sites in the northern Gulf of Mexico that differed in mean salinity.                                                                        At the time of sampling, oysters from the two sites differed in mass by 60\% and in parasite loads by nearly two orders of magnitude. They also differentially expressed 35\% of measured transcripts. However, we observed differential methylation at only 1.4\% of potentially methylated loci in comparisons between individuals from these different environments, and little correspondence between differential methylation and differential gene expression.                                                     Instead, methylation patterns were largely driven by genetic differences among families, with a PERMANOVA analysis indicating nearly a two orders of magnitude greater number of genes differentially methylated between families than between environments.

  abstract = {Sexual ornaments, which are traits that make an individual attractive to potential mates, have a long history in evolutionary biology. These adaptations to mate choice have been the subject of research from the perspective of genetics, ecology and theoretical biology. The rapid development of genomic methods has equipped modern genetics with new tools to answer old questions and open up new areas of analysis. For research into sexual ornamentation, this has meant the application of genetic mapping, in particular quantitative trait locus (QTL) methods, and transcriptomics to search for genes and biological pathways affecting ornamental traits and investigate pleiotropy between ornamental traits, ornament preference and fitness-related traits. Examples come from QTL studies of beak colour in the zebra finch, colocalisation between loci for ornaments and other traits in crickets and moths, QTL mapping and population genomics of colour in guppies and cichlids, genetical genomics and pleiotropy mapping of comb size in the chicken, transcriptomic studies of handicap mechanisms in the grouse, and genetics and molecular evolution of several sexual traits in Drosophila. Genomic methods help reveal the variety of mechanisms involved in sexual ornamentation and are complementary to quantitative genetics, population genetics and organismal studies.},

  abstract = {Domestication is one of the strongest forms of short-term, directional selection. Although selection is typically only exerted on one or a few target traits, domestication can lead to numerous changes in many seemingly unrelated phenotypes. It is unknown whether such correlated responses are due to pleiotropy or linkage between separate genetic architectures. Using three separate intercrosses between wild and domestic chickens, a locus affecting comb mass (a sexual ornament in the chicken) and several fitness traits (primarily medullary bone allocation and fecundity) was identified. This locus contains two tightly-linked genes, BMP2 and HAO1, which together produce the range of pleiotropic effects seen. This study demonstrates the importance of pleiotropy (or extremely close linkage) in domestication. The nature of this pleiotropy also provides insights into how this sexual ornament could be maintained in wild populations.},

  abstract = {Autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and coeliac disease are typical examples of complex genetic diseases caused by a combination of genetic and non-genetic risk factors. Insight into the genetic risk factors (single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) has increased since genome-wide association studies (GWAS) became possible in 2007 and, for individual diseases, SNPs can now explain some 15--50\% of genetic risk. GWAS have also shown that some 50\% of the genetic risk factors for individual autoimmune diseases overlap between different diseases. Thus, shared risk factors may converge to pathways that, when perturbed by genetic variation, predispose to autoimmunity in general. This raises the question of what determines disease specificity, and suggests that identical risk factors may have different effects in various autoimmune diseases. Addressing this question requires translation of genetic risk factors to causal genes and then to molecular and cellular pathways. Since {$>$}90\% of the genetic risk factors are found in the non-coding part of the genome (i.e. outside the exons of proteincoding genes) and can have an impact on gene regulation, there is an urgent need to better understand the non-coding part of the genome. Here, we will outline the methods being used to unravel the gene regulatory networks perturbed in autoimmune diseases and the importance of doing this in the relevant cell types. We will highlight findings in coeliac disease, which manifests in the small intestine, to demonstrate how cell type and disease context can impact on the consequences of genetic risk factors.},

Climatic factors such as ambient temperature, relative humidity, direct and indirect solar radiation and wind speed influence feed and water availability, fodder quality and disease occurrence, with production being most efficient in optimal environmental conditions. Among these climatic variables, ambient temperature fluctuations have the most impact on livestock production and animal welfare. Continuous exposure of the animals to heat stress compromises growth, milk and meat production and reproduction. The capacity of an animal to mitigate effects of increased environmental temperature, without progressing into stress response, differs within and between species. Comparatively, small ruminants are better adapted to hot environments than large ruminants and have better ability to survive, produce and reproduce in harsh climatic regions. Nevertheless, the physiological and behavioral changes in response to hot environments affect small ruminant production. It has been found that tropical breeds are more adaptive to hot climates than high-producing temperate breeds. The growing body of knowledge on the negative impact of heat stress on small ruminant production and welfare will assist in the development of suitable strategies to mitigate heat stress. Selection of thermotolerant breeds, through identification of genetic traits for adaption to extreme environmental conditions (high temperature, feed scarcity, water scarcity), is a viable strategy to combat climate change and minimize the impact on small ruminant production and welfare. This review highlights such adaption within and among different breeds of small ruminants challenged by heat stress.},

  abstract = {Multi-sire mating of a mob of ewes is commonly used in commercial sheep production systems. However, ram mating success (defined as the number of lambs sired by an individual) can vary between rams in the mating group. If this trait was repeatable and heritable, selection of rams capable of siring larger numbers of lambs could reduce the number of rams required for mating and ultimately lead to increased genetic gain. However, genetic correlations with other productive traits, such as growth and female fertility, could influence the potential for ram mating success to be used as a selection trait. In order to investigate this trait, parentage records (including accuracy of sire assignment) from 15 commercial ram breeding flocks of various breeds were utilised to examine the repeatability and heritability of ram mating success in multi-sire mating groups. In addition, genetic and phenotypic correlations with growth and female fertility traits were estimated using ASReml. The final model used for the ram mating success traits included age of the ram and mating group as fixed effects. Older rams (3 + years old) had 15\% to 20\% greater mating success than younger rams (1 or 2 years of age). Increasing the stringency of the criteria for inclusion of both an individual lamb, based on accuracy of sire assignment, or a whole mating group, based on how many lambs had an assigned sire, increased repeatability and heritability estimates of the ram mating success traits examined. With the most stringent criteria employed, where assignment of sire accuracy was {$>$}0.95 and the total number of lambs in the progeny group that failed to have a sire assigned was {$<$} 0.05, repeatability and heritability for loge(number of lambs) was 0.40 {\textpm} 0.09 and 0.26 {\textpm} 0.12, respectively. For proportion of lambs sired, repeatability and heritability were both 0.30 {\textpm} 0.09. The two ram mating traits (loge(nlamb) and proportion) were highly correlated, both phenotypically and genetically (0.88 {\textpm} 0.01 and 0.94 {\textpm} 0.06, respectively). Both phenotypic and genetic correlations between ram mating success and growth and other female fertility traits were low and non-significant. In conclusion, there is scope to select rams capable of producing high numbers of progeny and thus increase selection pressure on rams to increase genetic gain.},

Wild type, mutant and heterozygote for variants of such genes differ in the catalytic activity at the step in the enzyme network specified by the gene in question. The effect on the respective phenotypes of such changes in catalytic activity, however, is not defined by the enzyme change as estimated by in vitro determination of the activities obtained from the extracts of the three types. In vivo enzymes do not act in isolation, but are kinetically linked to other enzymes via their substrates and products. These interactions modify the effect of enzyme variation on the phenotype, depending on the nature and quantity of the other enzymes present. An output of such a system, say a flux, is therefore a systemic property, and its response to variation at one locus must be measured in the whole system. This response is best described by the sensitivity coefficient, Z, which is defined by the fractional change in flux over the fractional change in enzyme activity.},

Here, we investigated gender differences in visibility at the annual meetings of the Society of Molecular Biology and Evolution. The analysis of meeting programs showed a regular increase in female speakers for the last 16 years. Data on abstract submission suggest that there are no gender-related preferences in the acceptance of contributed presentations at the most recent meetings. However, data collected on-site in 2015 and 2016 show that women asked only \$25\% of the questions, that is, much less than expected given the female attendance. Understanding the reasons for this pattern is necessary for the development of policies that aim to reduce imbalance in visibility.},

Onset of a spectrum of morphological abnormalities, including defects in leaf structure, flowering time, and flower structure, was strictly associated with the ddml mutations. The morphological phenotypes arose at a high frequency in selfed ddml mutant lines and some phenotypes became progressively more severe in advancing generations. The transmission of two common morphological trait syndromes in genetic crosses demonstrated that the phenotypes are caused by heritable lesions that develop in ddml mutant backgrounds. Loss of cytosine methylation in specific genomic sequences during the selfing regime was noted in the ddml mutants. Potential mechanisms for formation of the lesions underlying the morphological abnormalities are discussed.},

  abstract = {DNA methylation was reported as a possible stress-adaptation mechanism involved in the transcriptional regulation of stress responsive genes. Limited data are available on effects of psychological stress and early-life nutritional stress on DNA methylation regulators [DNMTs: DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), DNMT1 associated protein (DMAP1), DNMT 3 alpha (DNMT3A) and beta (DNMT3B)] in avian species. The objectives of this study were to: (1) investigate changes in expression of DNMT1, DMAP1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B following acute (AS) or chronic immobilization stress (CS); (2) test immediate effect of early-life nutritional stress [food deprivation (FD) for 12 h (12hFD) or 36 h (36hFD) at the post-hatching period] on expression of DNA methylation regulators and glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and the long-term effect of early-life nutritional stress at 6 weeks of age. Expression of DNMTs and plasma corticosterone (CORT) concentration decreased by CS compared to AS (p {$<$} 0.05), indicating differential roles of DNA methylation regulators in the stress response. Plasma CORT at 12hFD and 36hFD birds increased compared to control birds (12hF and 36hF), but there were no significant differences in plasma CORT of 12hFD and 36hFD birds at 6 weeks of age compared to 6 week controls. DNMT1, DMAP1, and DNMT3B expression in the anterior pituitary increased by 12hFD, but decreased at 36hFD compared to their controls (P {$<$} 0.05). In liver, DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B expression decreased by 12hFD, however, no significant changes occurred at 36hFD. Expression of DMAP1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B in anterior pituitary and DMAP1 and DNMT3A expression in liver at 6 weeks of age were higher in 36hFD stressed birds compared to controls as well as 12hFD stressed birds. Hepatic GR expression decreased by 12hFD and increased by 36hFD (p {$<$} 0.05). Expression patterns of GR in the liver of FD stress-induced birds persisted until 6 weeks of age, suggesting the possible lifelong involvement of liver GR in early-life nutritional stress response of birds. Taken together, results suggest that DNA methylation regulator genes are tissue-specifically responsive to acute and chronic stress, and hepatic GR may play a critical role in regulating the early-life nutritional stress response of birds. In addition, the downregulation of DNMT1 and DMAP1 may be one of the adaptive mechanisms to chronic early-life nutritional stress via passive demethylation.},

Several recent genomic and simulation-based studies have argued that the field of conservation biology has placed too much focus on conserving genome-wide genetic variation, and that the field should instead focus on managing the subset of functional genetic variation that is thought to affect fitness. Here, we critically evaluate the feasibility and likely benefits of this approach in conservation. We find that population genetics theory and empirical results show that conserving genome-wide genetic variation is generally the best approach to prevent inbreeding depression and loss of adaptive potential from driving populations toward extinction. Focusing conservation efforts on presumably functional genetic variation will only be feasible occasionally, often misleading, and counterproductive when prioritized over genome-wide genetic variation. Given the increasing rate of habitat loss and other environmental changes, failure to recognize the detrimental effects of lost genome-wide genetic variation on long-term population viability will only worsen the biodiversity crisis.},

  abstract = {Inbreeding depression (reduced fitness of individuals with related parents) has long been a major focus of ecology, evolution, and conservation biology. Despite decades of research, we still have a limited understanding of the strength, underlying genetic mechanisms, and demographic consequences of inbreeding depression in the wild. Studying inbreeding depression in natural populations has been hampered by the inability to precisely measure individual inbreeding. Fortunately, the rapidly increasing availability of high-\-throughput sequencing data means it is now feasible to measure the inbreeding of any individual with high precision. Here, we review how genomic data are advancing our understanding of inbreeding depression in the wild. Recent results show that individual inbreeding and inbreeding depression can be measured more precisely with genomic data than via traditional pedigree analysis. Additionally, the availability of genomic data has made it possible to pinpoint loci with large effects contributing to inbreeding depression in wild populations, although this will continue to be a challenging task in many study systems due to low statistical power. Now that reliably measuring individual inbreeding is no longer a limitation, a major focus of future studies should be to more accurately quantify effects of inbreeding depression on population growth and viability.},

We examined the degree of conspicuousness and heritabilities of male secondary sexual traits in a feral guppy population in Okinawa, a subtropical island of Japan. Male guppies in this population showed high variation of their sexual traits such as dorsal and caudal fin lengths and redorange color spot patterns on their bodies. Offspring--parent regressions revealed significant heritabilities of male body size, dorsal and caudal fin lengths, and the number and relative area of orange spots. Especially, the high heritability of the relative orange spot area of sons compared to that of fathers suggests some Y chromosome-linked contribution of the trait. On the other hand, coloration (hue and saturation) of orange spots did not show significant inheritance, probably because most components of orange spot coloration may be condition-dependent traits. These results compared with previous work in native guppy populations suggest female mate preferences based upon these male secondary sexual traits and low predation pressure in this population.},

  abstract = {Mammalian genomes contain many highly conserved nongenic sequences (CNGs) whose functional significance is poorly understood. Sets of CNGs have previously been identified by selecting the most conserved elements from a chromosome or genome, but in these highly selected samples, conservation may be unrelated to purifying selection. Furthermore, conservation of CNGs may be caused by mutation rate variation rather than selective constraints. To account for the effect of selective sampling, we have examined conservation of CNGs in taxa whose evolution is largely independent of the taxa from which the CNGs were initially identified, and we have controlled for mutation rate variation in the genome. We show that selective constraints in CNGs and their flanks are about one-half as strong in hominids as in murids, implying that hominids have accumulated many slightly deleterious mutations in functionally important nongenic regions. This is likely to be a consequence of the low effective population size of hominids leading to a reduced effectiveness of selection. We estimate that there are one and two times as many conserved nucleotides in CNGs as in known protein-coding genes of hominids and murids, respectively. Polymorphism frequencies in CNGs indicate that purifying selection operates in these sequences. During hominid evolution, we estimate that a total of about three deleterious mutations in CNGs and protein-coding genes have been selectively eliminated per diploid genome each generation, implying that deleterious mutations are eliminated from populations non-independently and that sex is necessary for long-term population persistence.},

In vertebrates, estimates of genomic rates of deleterious mutations in protein-coding genes imply the existence of a substantial mutation load, but many functionally important regions of the genome are thought to reside in noncoding DNA, and the contribution of noncoding DNA to the mutation load has been unresolved. Here, we infer the frequency of deleterious mutations in noncoding DNA of rodents by comparing rates of substitution at noncoding nucleotides with rates of substitution at the fastest evolving intronic sites of adjacent genes sampled from the whole genome sequences of mouse and rat. We show that the major elements of selectively constrained noncoding DNA are within 2,500 bp upstream and downstream of coding sequences and in first introns. Our estimate of the genomic deleterious point mutation rate for noncoding DNA (0.22 per diploid per generation) is similar to that for coding DNA. Mammalian populations therefore experience a substantial genetic load associated with selection against deleterious mutations in noncoding DNA. Deleterious mutations in noncoding DNA have predominantly quantitative effects and could be an important source of the burden of complex genetic disease variation in human populations.},

Although hydrogen sulfide is toxic to most organisms, the fish Poecilia mexicana has adapted to survive in environments with high levels that exceed toxicity thresholds by orders of magnitude. Epigenetic changes in response to this environmental stressor were examined by assessing DNA methylation alterations in red blood cells, which are nucleated in fish. Males and females were sampled from sulfidic and nonsulfidic natural environments; individuals were also propagated for two generations in a nonsulfidic laboratory environment. We compared epimutations between the sexes as well as field and laboratory populations. For both the wild-caught (F0) and the laboratory-reared (F2) fish, comparing the sulfidic and nonsulfidic populations revealed evidence for significant differential DNA methylation regions (DMRs). More importantly, there was over 80\% overlap in DMRs across generations, suggesting that the DMRs have stable generational inheritance in the absence of the sulfidic environment. This is an example of epigenetic generational stability after the removal of an environmental stressor. The DMR-associated genes were related to sulfur toxicity and metabolic processes. These findings suggest that adaptation of P. mexicana to sulfidic environments in southern Mexico may, in part, be promoted through epigenetic DNA methylation alterations that become stable and are inherited by subsequent generations independent of the environment.},

We test this prediction by measuring the change in the mean flower size (⌬M) and the directional dominance of flower size (⌬B) within a selection experiment. If variation is due to rare (partially) recessive alleles, ⌬B/⌬M is expected to be positive and exceed one. However, we obtain negative values for ⌬B/⌬M from three independent selection lines. This result is statistically inconsistent with the deleterious-mutation model.},

  abstract = {Genomewide association studies have contributed immensely to our understanding of the genetic basis of complex traits. One major conclusion arising from these studies is that most traits are controlled by many loci of small effect, confirming the infinitesimal model of quantitative genetics. A popular approach to test for polygenic architecture involves so-called ``chromosome partitioning'' where phenotypic variance explained by each chromosome is regressed on the size of the chromosome. First developed for humans, this has now been repeatedly used in other species, but there has been no evaluation of the suitability of this method in species that can differ in their genome characteristics such as number and size of chromosomes. Nor has the influence of sample size, heritability of the trait, effect size distribution of loci controlling the trait or the physical distribution of the causal loci in the genome been examined. Using simulated data, we show that these characteristics have major influence on the inferences of the genetic architecture of traits we can infer using chromosome partitioning analyses. In particular, small variation in chromosome size, small sample size, low heritability, a skewed effect size distribution and clustering of loci can lead to a loss of power and consequently altered inference from chromosome partitioning analyses. Future studies employing this approach need to consider and derive an appropriate null model for their study system, taking these parameters into consideration. Our simulation results can provide some guidelines on these matters, but further studies examining a broader parameter space are needed.},

  abstract = {Individuals' reproductive success is often strongly associated with  their age, with typical patterns of early-life reproductive improvement  and late-life senescence. These age-related patterns are due to the  inherent trade-offs between life-history traits competing for a limited  amount of resources available to the organisms. In males, such trade-offs  are exacerbated by the resource requirements associated with the  expression of costly sexual traits, leading to dynamic changes in trait  expression throughout their life span. Due to the age dependency of male  phenotypes, the relationship between the expression of male traits and  mating success can also vary with male age. Hence, using longitudinal data  in a lekking species with strong sexual selection -- the black grouse  Lyrurus tetrix -- we quantified the effects of age, life span and age of  first lek attendance (AFL) on male annual mating success (AMS) to separate  the effects of within-individual improvement and senescence on AMS from  selective (dis)appearance of certain phenotypes. Then, we used male AMS to  quantify univariate and multivariate sexual selection gradients on male  morphological and behavioural traits with and without accounting for age  and age-related effects of other traits. Male AMS increased with age, and  there was no significant reproductive senescence. Most males never  copulated, and of the ones that did, the majority had only one successful  year. Life span was unrelated to AMS, but early AFL tended to lead to  higher AMS at ages 1--3. AMS was related to most morphological and  behavioural traits when male age was ignored. Accounting for age and  age-specific trait effects (i.e. the interaction between a trait and age)  reduced the magnitude of the selection gradients and revealed that  behavioural traits are under consistent sexual selection, while sexual  selection on morphological traits is stronger in old males. Therefore,  sexual selection in black grouse operates primarily on male behaviour and  morphological traits may act as additional cues to supplement female  choice. These results demonstrate the multifaceted influence of age on  both fitness and sexual traits and highlight the importance of accounting  for such effects when quantifying sexual selection.},

  abstract = {Age is a major factor explaining variation in life-history traits among individuals with typical patterns of increasing trait values early in life, maximum trait expression, and senescence. However, age-dependent variation in the expressions of sexually selected traits has received less attention, although such variation underpins differences in male competitive abilities and female preference, which are central to sexual selection. In contrast to previous studies focusing on single traits, we used repeated measures of seven sexually selected morphological and behavioral traits in male black grouse (Tetrao tetrix) to quantify the effects of age and life span on their expressions and quantified this variation in relation to male reproductive effort. Trait expression increased with age, but long-lived males had a slower increase and delayed maxima in trait values compared with shortlived males. There was evidence of terminal investment (increasing trait values during the last breeding season) in some traits and senescence in all traits. These trait dynamics were largely explained by the timing of male peak lekking effort. This study shows that fully understanding the variation in sexually selected traits and fitness benefits associated with sexual selection requires accounting for the complex interaction among individual age, life span, and the timing of individuals' investment in reproduction.},

  abstract = {Significance             Habitat fragmentation is sequestering species into small and isolated populations, with high chances of extinction. Are small and isolated populations at risk for extinction from inbreeding depression? Or does inbreeding and purging of deleterious alleles reduce such threat? Using whole genomes from several wild Indian tiger populations, we provide evidence supporting purging of highly deleterious variants in a small--isolated population. However, our analyses also indicate that the remaining highly deleterious alleles are at high frequencies, suggesting continued inbreeding depression despite some successful purging. We discuss the implications of our results for conservation, including possible genomics-informed genetic rescue strategies.           ,                             Increasing habitat fragmentation leads to wild populations becoming small, isolated, and threatened by inbreeding depression. However, small populations may be able to purge recessive deleterious alleles as they become expressed in homozygotes, thus reducing inbreeding depression and increasing population viability. We used whole-genome sequences from 57 tigers to estimate individual inbreeding and mutation load in a small--isolated and two large--connected populations in India. As expected, the small--isolated population had substantially higher average genomic inbreeding (               F               ROH               = 0.57) than the large--connected (               F               ROH               = 0.35 and               F               ROH               = 0.46) populations. The small--isolated population had the lowest loss-of-function mutation load, likely due to purging of highly deleterious recessive mutations. The large populations had lower missense mutation loads than the small--isolated population, but were not identical, possibly due to different demographic histories. While the number of the loss-of-function alleles in the small--isolated population was lower, these alleles were at higher frequencies and homozygosity than in the large populations. Together, our data and analyses provide evidence of 1) high mutation load, 2) purging, and 3) the highest predicted inbreeding depression, despite purging, in the small--isolated population. Frequency distributions of damaging and neutral alleles uncover genomic evidence that purifying selection has removed part of the mutation load across Indian tiger populations. These results provide genomic evidence for purifying selection in both small and large populations, but also suggest that the remaining deleterious alleles may have inbreeding-associated fitness costs. We suggest that genetic rescue from sources selected based on genome-wide differentiation could offset any possible impacts of inbreeding depression.},

  abstract = {Two sets of commercially available single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) developed for cattle (BovineSNP50 BeadChip) and sheep (OvineSNP50 BeadChip) have been trialed for whole-genome analysis of 4 female samples of Rangifer tarandus inhabiting Russia. We found out that 43.0\% of bovine and 47.0\% of Ovine SNPs could be genotyped, while only 5.3\% and 2.03\% of them were respectively polymorphic. The scored and the polymorphic SNPs were identified on each bovine and each ovine chromosome, but their distribution was not unique. The maximal value of runs of homozygosity (ROH) was 30.93\,Mb (for SNPs corresponding to bovine chromosome 8) and 80.32\,Mb (for SNPs corresponding to ovine chromosome 7). Thus, the SNP chips developed for bovine and ovine species can be used as a powerful tool for genome analysis in reindeer R. tarandus.},

  abstract = {Equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) have become essential considerations in different academic fields in recent years, attracting an increasing number of voices and perspectives from different groups. There is a need for an intersectionality framework that is inclusive of both the local and global diversity of researchers. Here, we present an intersectionality framework called KLOB which structures barriers to academic success into four components: knowledge exchange (K), language (L), obligations (O), and biases (B), and thus helps to think about the cumulative effect of multiple barriers that individuals from different backgrounds encounter to succeed in academic activities such as scientific publishing, which is the primary currency of academic success in our current system. This framework highlights both local and global disparities in socioeconomic, linguistic, and discriminatory factors that determine the opportunity of individual researchers to succeed in academia. We emphasise that individual researchers have no control over most barriers they face because of where and how they were born. Implementing solutions to address barriers associated with KLOB requires a multiscale vision and initiatives that tackle local and global inequities.},

Our study used not only sequence temperature data but also RGB images to gain breathing patterns in cattle. Mask R-CNN was used to detect the ROI (region of interest, nose) in the cattle RGB images. Mask segmentation from the ROI detection was applied to the corresponding temperature data. Finally, to visualize the breathing pattern, we calculated the temperature values in the ROI by averaging all temperature values in the ROI. The results in this study show 76\% accuracy with Mask R-CNN in detecting cattle noses. With respect to the temperature calculation methods, the averaging method showed the most appropriate breathing pattern compared to other methods (maximum temperature in the ROI and integrating all temperature values in the ROI). Finally, we compared the breathing pattern from the averaging method and that from the thermal image observation and found them to be highly correlated (R2 = 0.91). This method is not labor-intensive, can handle big data, and is accurate. In addition, we expect that the characteristics of the method might enable the analysis of temperature data from various angles.},

Male rhesus macaque (               Macaca mulatta               ) morphological traits are likely to reflect the effects of multiple sexual selection pressures. Here, we use a quantitative genetic approach to investigate the production and maintenance of variation in male rhesus macaque morphometric traits which may be subject to sexual selection. We collected measurements of body size, canine length, and fat, from 125 male and 21 female free-ranging rhesus macaques on Cayo Santiago. We also collected testis volumes from males. We used a genetic pedigree to calculate trait heritability, to investigate potential trait trade-offs, and to estimate selection gradients. We found that variation in most~male morphometric traits was heritable, but found no evidence of trait trade-offs nor that traits predicted reproductive success. Our results suggest that male rhesus macaque morphometric traits are either not under selection, or are under mechanisms of sexual selection that we could not test (e.g. balancing selection). In species subject to complex interacting mechanisms of selection, measures of body size, weaponry, and testis volume may not increase reproductive success via easily-testable mechanisms such as linear directional selection.},

  abstract = {We study the effects of a population bottleneck on the inbreeding depression and genetic load caused by deleterious mutations in an outcrossing population. The calculations assume that loci have multiplicative fitness effects and that linkage disequilibrium is negligible. Inbreeding depression decreases immediately after a sudden reduction of population size, but the drop is at most only several percentage points, even for severe bottlenecks. Highly recessive mutations experience a purging process that causes inbreeding depression to decline for a number of additional generations. On the basis of available parameter estimates, the absolute fall in inbreeding depression may often be only a few percentage points for bottlenecks of 10 or more individuals. With a very high lethal mutation rate and a very slow population growth, however, the decline may be on the order of 25\%. We examine when purging might favor a switch from outbreeding to selfing and find it occurs only under very limited conditions unless population growth is very slow. In contrast to inbreeding depression, a bottleneck causes an immediate increase in the genetic load. Purging causes the load to decline and then overshoot its equilibrium value. The changes are typically modest: the absolute increase in the total genetic load will be at most a few percentage points for bottlenecks of size 10 or more unless the lethal mutation rate is very high and the population growth rate very slow.},

In general, these hybrids are regarded as infertile; however, conclusive evidence that F1-hybrids are infertile and unable to backcross in the wild are lacking. Using a molecular approach, we examined the ancestry of a bird assumed to be a male hybrid based on phenotypic characters. The specimen was legally shot during the hunting season in northern Norway in an area where the black grouse is common and the capercaillie is relatively rare. Analysis of the maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA revealed that the mother of the specimen was of capercaillie origin, while a diagnostic sex-chromosome (Z) linked microsatellite marker showed that the father had a black grouse allele. Diagnostic autosomal microsatellite markers revealed that the specimen was a backcross and not a first-generation hybrid. As galliform birds follow Haldane's rule, i.e., that hybrid sterility is common in the heterogametic sex (female in birds), the hybrid parent of the backcross was, thus, likely a male. Our findings provide molecular evidence that capercaillie {\texttimes} black grouse F1-hybrid males can be fertile and successfully mate and backcross in a wild population.},

In particular, we suggest that when natural selection acts on pure epigenetic variation in addition to genetic variation, populations adapt faster, and adaptive phenotypes can arise before any genetic changes. This may make it difficult to reconcile the timing of adaptive events detected using conventional population genetics tools based on DNA sequence data with environmental drivers of adaptation, such as changes in climate. Epigenetic modifications are frequently associated with somatic cell differentiation, but recently epigenetic changes have been found that can be transmitted over many generations. Here, we show how the interplay of these heritable epigenetic changes with genetic changes can affect adaptive evolution, and how epigenetic changes affect the signature of selection in the genetic record.},

Inheritance is primarily in cis with the locus, occurs through both oocytes and sperm, and is associated with altered trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3) before the onset of zygotic transcription. Expression profiling reveals that temperature-induced expression from endogenous repressed repeats can also be inherited for multiple generations. Long-lasting epigenetic memory of environmental change is therefore possible in this animal.},

  abstract = {Chance plays a critical but underappreciated role in determining mating success. In many cases, we tend to think of chance as background noise that can be ignored in studies of mating dynamics. When the influence of chance is consistent across contexts, chance can be thought of as background noise; in other cases, however, the impact of chance on mating success can influence our understanding of how mates are acquired and how sexual selection operates. In particular, when the importance of chance covaries with biological or ecological factors in a systematic manner---\-that is, when chance becomes consistently more or less important under certain conditions---\- then chance is important to consider if we want to fully understand the operation of mate acquisition and sexual selection. Here, we present a model that explores how chance covaries with factors such as sex ratio, adult population size, and mating regime in determining variation in mating success. We find that in some cases, chance covaries with adult population size and the operational sex ratio to create variation in mating success. We discuss how chance can influence our more general understanding of the operation of mating dynamics and sexual selection.},

  abstract = {Past developments in livestock breeding have led to considerable genetic change in production traits, but the follow-up of nutrition and management is often incomplete. The pig production sector is moving to hotter climates, and to more intensive and limiting conditions. This increases demands for animal robustness. Robustness can be implemented as a breeding objective trait just like production traits. Breeding for robustness is feasible, but requires substantial investment in data and technology. As for all low-heritability traits with complicated data recording, DNA markers provide a useful tool to support selection; this requires good association studies and ongoing multiple marker development. Breeding for increased robustness must be implemented in balance with breeding for increased production. It is therefore useful to define robustness in terms of performance-relevant issues. A convenient approach is through the environmental sensitivity of the expression of genetic production potential. Environmental sensitivity illustrates loss of flexibility to deal with intensive or limiting conditions, due to unbalanced resource allocation. It can be quantified for individual animals in terms of reaction norm parameters, which can be used as estimated breeding values to support selection. The challenges of implementing such a system will be (i) the set-up of proper data collection in a wide range of environmental settings; (ii) the development of proper data processing tools; (iii) the design of suitable breeding objectives and selection criteria, including MAS; and (iv) the successful integration of the first 3 objectives.},

  abstract = {When data are not normally distributed, researchers are often uncertain whether it is legitimate to use tests that assume Gaussian errors, or whether one has to either model a more specific error structure or use randomization techniques. Here we use Monte Carlo simulations to explore the pros and cons of fitting Gaussian models to non-normal data in terms of risk of type I error, power and utility for parameter estimation. We find that Gaussian models are robust to non-normality over a wide range of conditions, meaning that p values remain fairly reliable except for data with influential outliers judged at strict alpha levels. Gaussian models also performed well in terms of power across all simulated scenarios. Parameter estimates were mostly unbiased and precise except if sample sizes were small or the distribution of the predictor was highly skewed. Transformation of data before analysis is often advisable and visual inspection for outliers and heteroscedasticity is important for assessment. In strong contrast, some non-Gaussian models and randomization techniques bear a range of risks that are often insufficiently known. High rates of false-positive conclusions can arise for instance when overdispersion in count data is not controlled appropriately or when randomization procedures ignore existing non-independencies in the data. Hence, newly developed statistical methods not only bring new opportunities, but they can also pose new threats to reliability. We argue that violating the normality assumption bears risks that are limited and manageable, while several more sophisticated approaches are relatively error prone and particularly difficult to check during peer review. Scientists and reviewers who are not fully aware of the risks might benefit from preferentially trusting Gaussian mixed models in which random effects account for non-independencies in the data.},

To qualify as a cost in line with theoretical models, empirical studies must demonstrate that sexual traits cause negative effects on one component of fitness of the trait bearer. Moreover, it must be demonstrated that the costs are differential such that negative effects on fitness are more severe for individuals in poor condition than for individuals in good condition. However, in the current literature, there is confusion over what qualifies as a cost, and costs are often anticipated based on findings of increased expenditure. Consequently, it seems that the generally accepted notion that sexual traits are costly is in fact based almost exclusively on indirect evidence and that direct empirical evidence is very scarce.},

  author = {Krause, E Tobias and Caspers, Barbara A},
  abstract = {Fire salamanders are amphibians that exhibit a highly specific reproductive mode termed ovo-viviparity. The eggs develop inside their mothers, and the females give birth to fully developed larvae. The larvae in our study area cluster in two distinct genetic groups that can be linked directly to the habitat (stream or pond) in which the larvae were deposited. Apart from genetic differences, larvae living in the two different habitat types differ morphologically, indicating that female fire salamanders exhibit some type of ecological adaptation to the different habitats. In this study, we investigated whether pregnant fire salamander females of the two habitat-specific genotypes (stream and pond) specifically prefer to deposit their larvae in water bodies with a continuous current (i.e., emulated stream habitats) or those without a current (i.e., emulated pond habitats). We assumed that the presence of a water current might be used by the females as a cue to deposit their larvae in the matching aquatic habitat (flowing/stagnant) according to their own habitat-specific genotype. However, the female fire salamanders of the two habitat-specific genotypes did not show predilections for depositing their larvae in the water body that would match their genotype cluster (stream/pond). Furthermore, the larval genotype did not necessarily match the water type in which the larvae were deposited. Overall, this study aimed to test whether fire salamander females of two different habitat-linked genotypes use the presence/absence of a water current as a criterion for choosing an aquatic habitat for larval deposition. Our data do not support this hypothesis, leading to the assumption that fire salamander females use other environmental cues to select water bodies for larval deposition.},

  abstract = {Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation or histone modifications, can be transmitted between cellular or organismal generations. However, there are no experiments measuring their role in adaptation, so here we use experimental evolution to investigate how epigenetic variation can contribute to adaptation. We manipulated DNA methylation and histone acetylation in the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii both genetically and chemically to change the amount of epigenetic variation generated or transmitted in adapting populations in three different environments (salt stress, phosphate starvation, and high CO2) for two hundred asexual generations. We find that reducing the amount of epigenetic variation available to populations can reduce adaptation in environments where it otherwise happens. From genomic and epigenomic sequences from a subset of the populations, we see changes in methylation patterns between the evolved populations over-represented in some functional categories of genes, which is consistent with some of these differences being adaptive. Based on whole genome sequencing of evolved clones, the majority of DNA methylation changes do not appear to be linked to cis-acting genetic mutations. Our results show that transgenerational epigenetic effects play a role in adaptive evolution, and suggest that the relationship between changes in methylation patterns and differences in evolutionary outcomes, at least for quantitative traits such as cell division rates, is complex.

Male red deer with large antlers had increased lifetime breeding success, both before and after correcting for body size, generating a standardized selection gradient of 0.44 (Ϯ0.18 SE). Despite substantial age- and environment-related variation, antler size was also heritable (heritability of antler mass ϭ 0.33 Ϯ 0.12). However the observed selection did not generate an evolutionary response in antler size over the study period of nearly 30 years, and there was no evidence of a positive genetic correlation between antler size and fitness nor of a positive association between breeding values for antler size and fitness. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that a heritable trait under directional selection will not evolve if associations between the measured trait and fitness are determined by environmental covariances: In red deer males, for example, both antler size and success in the fights for mates may be heavily dependent on an individual's nutritional state.},

  abstract = {Runs of homozygosity (ROH) have been widely used to study population history and trait architecture in humans and livestock species, but their application in selfincompatible plants has not been reported. The distributions of ROH in 199 accessions representing Asian pears (45), European pears (109), and interspecific hybrids (45) were investigated using genotyping-by-sequencing in this study. Fruit phenotypes including fruit weight, firmness, Brix, titratable acidity, and flavor volatiles were measured for genotype-phenotype analyses. The average number of ROH and the average total genomic length of ROH were 6 and 11 Mb, respectively, in Asian accessions, and 13 and 30 Mb, respectively, in European accessions. Significant associations between genomic inbreeding coefficients (FROH) and phenotypes were observed for 23 out of 32 traits analyzed. An overlap between ROH islands and significant markers from genome-wide association analyses was observed. Previously published quantitative trait loci for fruit traits and disease resistances also overlapped with some of the ROH islands. A prominent ROH island at the bottom of linkage group 17 overlapped with a recombination-supressed genomic region harboring the self-incompatibility locus. The observed ROH patterns suggested that systematic breeding of European pears would have started earlier than of Asian pears. Our research suggest that FROH would serve as a novel tool for managing inbreeding in gene-banks of self-incompatible plant species. ROH mapping provides a complementary strategy to unravel the genetic architecture of complex traits, and to evaluate differential selection in outbred plants. This seminal work would provide foundation for the ROH research in self-incompatible plants.},

  abstract = {Background:{\enspace} Many wild species have suffered drastic population size declines over the past centuries, which have led to `genomic erosion' processes characterized by reduced genetic diversity, increased inbreeding, and accumulation of harmful muta-tions. Yet, genomic erosion estimates of modern-day populations often lack concord-ance with dwindling population sizes and conservation status of threatened species. One way to directly quantify the genomic consequences of population declines is to compare genome-wide data from pre-decline museum samples and modern samples. However, doing so requires computational data processing and analysis tools specifi-cally adapted to comparative analyses of degraded, ancient or historical, DNA data with modern DNA data as well as personnel trained to perform such analyses. Results:{\enspace} Here, we present a highly flexible, scalable, and modular pipeline to compare patterns of genomic erosion using samples from disparate time periods. The GenErode pipeline uses state-of-the-art bioinformatics tools to simultaneously process wholegenome re-sequencing data from ancient/historical and modern samples, and to produce comparable estimates of several genomic erosion indices. No programming knowledge is required to run the pipeline and all bioinformatic steps are well-docu-mented, making the pipeline accessible to users with different backgrounds. GenErode is written in Snakemake and Python3 and uses Conda and Singularity containers to achieve reproducibility on high-performance compute clusters. The source code is freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/NBISweden/GenErode). Conclusions:{\enspace} GenErode is a user-friendly and reproducible pipeline that enables the standardization of genomic erosion indices from temporally sampled whole genome re-sequencing data.},

  abstract = {Scientific awards can shape scientific careers, helping secure jobs and grants. Awards also have a potential to reinforce the ``Matthew Effect'' and the quest for ``novelty'' in science when eligibility and assessment criteria give preference to nominees with traditional careers and to ``excellent'' research. As such, recognition awards for early and mid-career researchers can contribute to the lack of intersectional diversity at the senior levels and in elite networks of scientists. To assess the status quo and historical trends, we evaluated ``best researcher'' awards and ``best paper'' early and mid-career awards from broad-scope international journals and societies in ecology and evolution. Specifically, we collated information on eligibility rules and assessment criteria and quantified historical gender biases in the lists of past winners. Our results reveal that, overall, few awards foster equitable access and assessment. Although many awards now explicitly allow extensions of the eligibility period for significant career interruptions, there is a general lack of transparency in terms of assessment and consideration of other differences in access to opportunities and resources among junior researchers. Strikingly, Open Science practices were valued in only one award. By highlighting instances of desirable award characteristics, we hope this work will nudge award committees to shift from simple but non-equitable award policies and practices towards strategies enhancing inclusivity and diversity. Such shift would benefit not only these at the early and mid-career stages, but the whole research community. It is also an untapped opportunity to reward Open Science practices, promoting transparent and robust science.},

We show an overrepresentation of genes related to neuronal functions, learning and cognition in regions under positive selection, as well as increased CpG methylation in these regions. In addition, great tit neuronal non-CpG methylation patterns are very similar to those observed in mammals, suggesting a universal role in neuronal epigenetic regulation which can affect learning-, memory- and experience-induced plasticity. The high-quality great tit genome assembly will play an instrumental role in furthering the integration of ecological, evolutionary, behavioural and genomic approaches in this model species.},

Here, we propose that niche construction initiates and modifies the selection directly affecting the constructor, and on other species, in an orderly, directed and sustained manner. By dependably generating specific environmental states, niche construction co-directs adaptive evolution by imposing a consistent statistical bias on selection. We illustrate how niche construction can generate this evolutionary bias by comparing it with artificial selection. We suggest that it occupies the middle ground between artificial and natural selection. We show how the perspective leads to testable predictions related to: (i) reduced variance in measures of responses to natural selection in the wild; (ii) multiple trait coevolution, including the evolution of sequences of traits and patterns of parallel evolution; and (iii) a positive association between niche construction and biodiversity. More generally, we submit that evolutionary biology would benefit from greater attention to the diverse properties of all sources of selection.},

  abstract = {A naturally occurring phenomenon known as heterosis, also known as hybrid vigor, occurs when the offspring of genetically diverse individual (parental line) outperform their parents in terms of physical characteristics such as functional ability, growth, and development. Crossing of Parental cultivars produces offspring with higher biomass, grain yield, and growth rates than their inbred parental lines, and has been used in agriculture for many years to boost yields and yield per acre. In an F1 hybrid, heterosis refers to the offspring's morphological and genetic superiority over the inbred parental population. Heterosis is the superiority of offspring physical and genetic features over inbred parents. In hybrid improvement, heterosis is important because it helps plant breeders to better harness the hybrid vigor of both non-inbred and inbred parental material, increasing hybrid breeding success rates. Because heterosis is used in so many crops, a variety of hybrids have emerged. The heterotic groups of inbred parental lines and their ability to merge define the inbred paternal lines and breeding aims for a healthy breeding program. In India, maize is the most significant food crop, accounting for around a quarter of total output. Its high cross-pollinated crop gives several options for increasing hybrid vigor. As a result, once heterosis, or hybrid vigour, has been achieved, it is vital in hybrid development. Several studies are presently underway to determine the molecular basis of heterosis. Molecular markers have enabled researchers to determine the genetic origin of heterosis development at the gene-expression or molecular level. It assists in identifying the genes responsible for the desired traits, as well as their chromosomal location. Molecular marker technology has been utilized to assist find desired genes in genomic regions that lead to heterosis. On the genetic and molecular basis of heterosis, as well as its contemporary advances and usage in agricultural plants, particularly those produced for human use.},

The homozygous genome could exacerbate inbreeding depression by introducing homozygous deleterious alleles in the population. However, purging of inbreeding loads as they become homozygotes in small populations could alleviate the depression. The Amur tiger (             Panthera tigris altaica             ) is typically exists in small population living in forests in Northeast Asia and is among the most endangered animals on the planet with great symbolic significance of conservation. By comparing with captive individuals, we revealed substantially higher and more extensive inbreeding in the wild Amur tiger population (F             ROH             =0.51) than in captive Amur tigers (F             ROH             =0.26). We further found much less mutational loads in wild populations when compared with captive Amur tigers. However, the frequency of loss of function and deleterious nonsynonymous mutations inside ROH regions are much lower than that in non-ROH regions in both wild and captive Amur tigers, indicating the purging may had occurred in both populations but much effective in the wild population. In addition, we found the average frequency of deleterious alleles was much lower than that of neutral alleles in the wild population, indicating that the purifying selection contributed to the purging of mutational loads in the wild Amur tigers. These findings provide valuable genome-wide evidence to support the making of future conservation plans of wild Amur tigers.},

  abstract = {Understanding the genetic bases underlying heterosis is a major issue in maize (Zea mays L.). We extended the North Carolina design III (NCIII) by using three populations of recombinant inbred lines derived from three parental lines belonging to different heterotic pools, crossed with each parental line to obtain nine families of hybrids. A total of 1253 hybrids were evaluated for grain moisture, silking date, plant height, and grain yield. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping was carried out on the six families obtained from crosses to parental lines following the ``classical'' NCIII method and with a multiparental connected model on the global design, adding the three families obtained from crosses to the nonparental line. Results of the QTL detection highlighted that most of the QTL detected for grain yield displayed apparent overdominance effects and limited differences between heterozygous genotypes, whereas for grain moisture predominance of additive effects was observed. For plant height and silking date results were intermediate. Except for grain yield, most of the QTL identified showed significant additive-by-additive epistatic interactions. High correlation observed between heterosis and the heterozygosity of hybrids at markers confirms the complex genetic basis and the role of dominance in heterosis. An important proportion of QTL detected were located close to the centromeres. We hypothesized that the lower recombination in these regions favors the detection of (i) linked QTL in repulsion phase, leading to apparent overdominance for heterotic traits and (ii) linked QTL in coupling phase, reinforcing apparent additive effects of linked QTL for the other traits.},

We compared the genetic diversity in the last extant Dutch population with Dutch museum samples and three other black grouse populations (from England, Austria and Norway, respectively) representing isolated and continuous populations. We found significantly lower allelic richness, observed and expected heterozygosities in the present Dutch population compared to the continuous populations (Austria and Norway) and also to the historical Dutch population. However, using a bottleneck test on each population, signs of heterozygosity excess were only found in the likewise isolated English population despite that strong genetic drift was evident in the present Dutch population in comparison to the reference populations, as assessed both in pairwise FST and STRUCTURE analyses. Simulating the effect of a population reduction on the Dutch population from 1948 onwards, using census data and with the Dutch museum samples as a model for the genetic diversity in the initial population, revealed that the loss in number of alleles and observed heterozygosity was according to genetic drift expectations and within the standard error range of the present Dutch population. Thus, the effect of the strong decline in the number of grouse on genetic diversity was only detectable when using a reference from the past. The lack of evidence for a population reduction in the present Dutch population by using the program BOTTLENECK was attributed to a rapidly found new equilibrium as a consequence of a very small effective population size.},

Epigenetic mechanisms likely facilitate the success of introduced house sparrows by aiding particular individuals to adjust their phenotypes plastically to novel conditions. Our objective here was to investigate patterns of DNA methylation among populations of house sparrows at a broad geographic scale that included different introduction histories: invading, established, and native. We defined the invading category as the locations with introductions less than 70 years ago and the established category as the locations with greater than 70 years since introduction. We screened DNA methylation among individuals (n = 45) by epiRADseq, expecting that variation in DNA methylation among individuals from invading populations would be higher when compared with individuals from established and native populations. Invading house sparrows had the highest variance in DNA methylation of all three groups, but established house sparrows also had higher variance than native ones. The highest number of differently methylated regions were detected between invading and native populations of house sparrow. Additionally, DNA methylation was negatively correlated to time-since introduction, which further suggests that DNA methylation had a role in the successful colonization's of house sparrows.},

To do so, we produced whole-genome sequencing data for two pairs of Asian populations exhibiting different alliance rules and rates of inbreeding, but with similar effective population sizes. The results show that populations with higher rates of inbred matings do not purge deleterious variants more efficiently. Purging therefore has a low efficiency in human populations, and different mating practices lead to a similar mutational load.Keywords: purifying selection, kinship, mate choice, inbreeding, genomics, deleterious variants, mutational load},

  abstract = {This essay comments on recent research on Darwinian fisheries science and on the future development of this field. From a practical point of view, the key question is: how fast are evolutionary changes caused by fishing happening? To answer this question, there is a need to understand intensities of selection generated by fishing, heritabilities and genetic correlations of the traits under selection, and whether the rates of change in traits predicted from this information are consistent with the changes observed. Although there is little doubt about the existence of phenotypic change in life-history traits of exploited fish stocks, there are few direct estimates of selection differentials caused by fishing. Results that are available, together with the relatively low heritabilities of life-history traits, suggest that the evolution caused by fishing occurs at a modest rate, and is likely to need a decadal time scale to be clearly observable. Given the pressing need for attention to fisheries in the short term, measures to control the longer-term evolutionary impact of fishing are most likely to be adopted if they also help to meet short-term objectives of management. With this in mind, the essay mounts a defence of large, old fish, the presence of which would be beneficial to stocks in the short term, and the conservation of which would set in motion selection for improved growth in the longer term.},

However, a full understanding of the effect of dispersal on the occurrence of inbred matings requires estimating the inbreeding risks prior to dispersal. Combining pairwise relatedness measures and kinship assignments, we investigated in black grouse whether the observed occurrence of inbred matings was explained by active kin discrimination or by female-biased dispersal. In this large continuous population, copulations between close relatives were rare. As female mate choice was random for relatedness, females with more relatives in the local flock tended to mate with genetically more similar males. To quantify the initial risks of inbreeding, we measured the relatedness to the males of females captured in their parental flock and virtually translocated female hatchlings in their parental and to more distant flocks. These tests indicated that dispersal decreased the likelihood of mating with relatives and that philopatric females had higher inbreeding risks than the actual breeding females. As females do not discriminate against relatives, the few inbred matings were probably due to the variance in female dispersal propensity and dispersal distance. Our results support the view that kin discrimination mate choice is of little value if dispersal effectively reduces the risks of inbreeding.},

  abstract = {In group living species, individuals may gain the indirect fitness benefits characterizing kin selection when groups contain close relatives. However, tests of kin selection have primarily focused on cooperatively breeding and eusocial species, whereas its importance in other forms of group living remains to be fully understood. Lekking is a form of grouping where males display on small aggregated territories, which females then visit to mate. As females prefer larger aggregations, territorial males might gain indirect fitness benefits if their presence increases the fitness of close relatives. Previous studies have tested specific predictions of kin selection models using measures such as group-level relatedness. However, a full understanding of the contribution of kin selection in the evolution of group living requires estimating individuals' indirect fitness benefits across multiple sites and years. Using behavioural and genetic data from the black grouse (Tetrao tetrix), we show that the indirect fitness benefits of group membership were very small because newcomers joined leks containing few close relatives who had limited mating success. Males' indirect fitness benefits were higher in yearlings during increasing population density but marginally changed the variation in male mating success. Kin selection acting through increasing group size is therefore unlikely to contribute substantially to the evolution and maintenance of lekking in this black grouse population.},

  abstract = {In lekking species, males cluster on specific areas for display (the leks) and females generally prefer to copulate with males on large aggregations. The maintenance of leks in which only a few males reproduce might be explained if subordinate males gain indirect fitness benefits. By joining a lek on which relatives are displaying, subordinates might attract more females to the lek thereby increasing the mating opportunities of their kin. In black grouse, a genetic structure among leks has previously been found suggesting that relatives could display together. Using 11 microsatellite loci, we extended this result by testing for the presence of kin structures in nine black grouse leks (101 males). The genetic differentiation among flocks was higher in males than in females, suggesting female-biased dispersal and male philopatry. Because of this genetic structure, males were more related within than among leks. However, the mean relatedness within each lek hardly differed from zero. The lekking males were not more related than random assortments of males from the winter flocks and there were no kin clusters within leks. Thus, black grouse males do not choose to display with and close to relatives. Male philopatry alone was not sufficient to induce elevated levels of relatedness on the leks either because of male partial dispersal or a rapid turnover of the successful males. The indirect fitness benefits associated with males' settlement decision are probably limited compared to the direct benefits of joining large aggregations such as increased current and future mating opportunities.},

  abstract = {In bird species with pair bonds, extra-pair matings could allow females to choose genetically superior males. This is not needed in lekking species because female choice is not constrained by pairing opportunities. However, polyandry has been reported in most lekking species studied so far. Using 12 microsatellite loci, we determined the paternity of 135 broods of black grouse sampled between 2001 and 2005 (970 hatchlings and 811 adult birds genotyped). The paternity assignments were combined to lek observations to investigate the mating behaviour of black grouse females. About 10\% of the matings seemed to take place with males displaying solitarily. Forty per cent of the copulations between males displaying on the studied leks and radio-tagged females were not recorded. This was due to difficulties in identifying the females and because our observations did not cover all the possible time for matings. However, females of the undetected copulations had chosen males that were already known to be successful on the leks. There was a strong consistency between the observations and true paternity, even when the copulation was disturbed by a neighbouring male. Multiple mating and multiple paternities were rare. We can now confidently ascertain that most females mate only once with one male for the whole clutch. This mating behaviour requires that a single insemination is sufficient to fertilize a clutch and that females can determine whether the sperm has been successfully transferred. Grouse Tetraoninae with many lekking species may be the only bird taxon that has evolved these traits.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Motivation: Identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that underlie common and complex human diseases, such as cancer, is of major interest in current molecular epidemiology. Nevertheless, the tremendous number of SNPs on the human genome requires computational methods for prioritizing SNPs according to their potentially deleterious effects to human health, and as such, for expediting genotyping and analysis. As of yet, little has been done to quantitatively assess the possible deleterious effects of SNPs for effective association studies.             Results: We propose a new integrative scoring system for prioritizing SNPs based on their possible deleterious effects within a probabilistic framework. We applied our system to 580 disease-susceptibility genes obtained from the OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) database, which is one of the most widely used databases of human genes and genetic disorders. The scoring results clearly show that the distribution of the functional significance (FS) scores for already known disease-related SNPs is significantly different from that of neutral SNPs. In addition, we summarize distinct features of potentially deleterious SNPs based on their FS score, such as functional genomic regions where they occur or bio-molecular functions that they mainly affect. We also demonstrate, through a comparative study, that our system improves upon other function-assessment systems for SNPs, by assigning significantly higher FS scores to already known disease-related SNPs than to neutral SNPs.

  abstract = {High-throughput sequencing is a powerful tool, but suffers biases and errors that must be accounted for to prevent false biological conclusions. Such errors include batch effects; technical errors only present in subsets of data due to procedural changes within a study. If overlooked and multiple batches of data are combined, spurious biological signals can arise, particularly if batches of data are correlated with biological variables. Batch effects can be minimized through randomization of sample groups across batches. However, in long-term or multiyear studies where data are added incrementally, full randomization is impossible, and batch effects may be a common feature. Here, we present a case study where false signals of selection were detected due to a batch effect in a multiyear study of Alpine ibex (Capra ibex). The batch effect arose because sequencing read length changed over the course of the project and populations were added incrementally to the study, resulting in nonrandom distributions of populations across read lengths. The differences in read length caused small misalignments in a subset of the data, leading to false variant alleles and thus false SNPs. Pronounced allele frequency differences between populations arose at these SNPs because of the correlation between read length and population. This created highly statistically significant, but biologically spurious, signals of selection and false associations between allele frequencies and the environment. We highlight the risk of batch effects and discuss strategies to reduce the impacts of batch effects in multiyear high-throughput sequencing studies.},

The main difference between conversational sentiment analysis and single sentence sentiment analysis is the existence of context information which may influence the sentiment of an utterance in a dialogue. How to effectively encode contextual information in dialogues, however, remains a challenge. Existing approaches employ complicated deep learning structures to distinguish different parties in a conversation and then model the context information. In this paper, we propose a fast, compact and parameter-efficient party-ignorant framework named bidirectional emotional recurrent unit for conversational sentiment analysis. In our system, a generalized neural tensor block followed by a two-channel classifier is designed to perform context compositionality and sentiment classification, respectively. Extensive experiments on three standard datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the state of the art in most cases.},

Bisulphite sequencing is commonly used for assessing genome-wide DNA methylation at single nucleotide resolution but these data can also provide information on genetic variants like single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, bisulphite conversion causes unmethylated cytosines to appear as thymines, complicating the alignment and subsequent SNP calling. Several tools have been developed to overcome this challenge, but there is no independent evaluation of such tools for non-model species, which often lack genomic references. Here, we used whole-genome bisulphite sequencing (WGBS) data from four female great tits (Parus major) to evaluate the performance of seven tools for SNP calling from bisulphite sequencing data. We used SNPs from whole-genome resequencing data of the same samples as baseline SNPs to assess common performance metrics like sensitivity, precision, and the number of true positive, false positive, and false negative SNPs for the full range of variant and genotype quality values. We found clear differences between the tools in either optimizing precision (Bis-SNP), sensitivity (biscuit), or a compromise between both (all other tools). Overall, the choice of SNP caller strongly depends on which performance parameter should be maximized and whether ascertainment bias should be minimized to optimize downstream analysis, highlighting the need for studies that assess such differences.},

However, our understanding of how circannual traits such as timing of reproduction are regulated on a molecular level remains limited. Recent studies have implicated that epigenetic mechanisms can be an important part in the processes that regulate circannual traits. Here, we explore the role of DNA methylation in mediating reproductive timing in a seasonally breeding bird species, the great tit (Parus major), using genome-wide DNA methylation data from individual females that were blood sampled repeatedly throughout the breeding season. We demonstrate rapid and directional changes in DNA methylation within the promoter region of several genes, including a key transcription factor (NR5A1) known from earlier studies to be involved in the initiation of timing of reproduction. Interestingly, the observed changes in DNA methylation at NR5A1 identified here are in line with earlier gene expression studies of reproduction in chicken, indicating that the observed shifts in DNA methylation at this gene can have a regulatory role. Our findings provide an important step towards elucidating the genomic mechanism that mediates seasonal timing of a key life history traits and provide support for the idea that epigenetic mechanisms may play an important role in circannual traits.},

  abstract = {Background: DNA methylation is likely a key mechanism regulating changes in gene transcription in traits that show temporal fluctuations in response to environmental conditions. To understand the transcriptional role of DNA methylation we need simultaneous within-individual assessment of methylation changes and gene expression changes over time. Within-individual repeated sampling of tissues, which are essential for trait expression is, however, unfeasible (e.g. specific brain regions, liver and ovary for reproductive timing). Here, we explore to what extend between-individual changes in DNA methylation in a tissue accessible for repeated sampling (red blood cells (RBCs)) reflect such patterns in a tissue unavailable for repeated sampling (liver) and how these DNA methylation patterns are associated with gene expression in such inaccessible tissues (hypothalamus, ovary and liver). For this, 18 great tit (Parus major) females were sacrificed at three time points (n = 6 per time point) throughout the pre-laying and egg-laying period and their blood, hypothalamus, ovary and liver were sampled. Results: We simultaneously assessed DNA methylation changes (via reduced representation bisulfite sequencing) and changes in gene expression (via RNA-seq and qPCR) over time. In general, we found a positive correlation between changes in CpG site methylation in RBCs and liver across timepoints. For CpG sites in close proximity to the transcription start site, an increase in RBC methylation over time was associated with a decrease in the expression of the associated gene in the ovary. In contrast, no such association with gene expression was found for CpG site methylation within the gene body or the 10 kb up- and downstream regions adjacent to the gene body. Conclusion: Temporal changes in DNA methylation are largely tissue-general, indicating that changes in RBC methylation can reflect changes in DNA methylation in other, often less accessible, tissues such as the liver in our case. However, associations between temporal changes in DNA methylation with changes in gene expression are mostly tissue- and genomic location-dependent. The observation that temporal changes in DNA methylation within RBCs can relate to changes in gene expression in less accessible tissues is important for a better understanding of how environmental conditions shape traits that temporally change in expression in wild populations.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Sexual selection on fitness-determining traits should theoretically erode genetic variance and lead to low heritability. However, many sexually selected traits maintain significant phenotypic and additive genetic variance, with explanations for this ``lek paradox'' including genic capture due to condition-dependence, and breaks on directional selection due to environmental sources of variance including maternal effects. Here we investigate genetic and environmental sources of variance in the intrasexually selected green badge of the sand lizard (               Lacerta agilis               ). The badge functions as a cue to male fighting ability in this species, and male--male interactions determine mate acquisition. Using animal models on a pedigree including three generations of males measured over an extensive 9-year field study, we partition phenotypic variance in both badge size and body condition into additive genetic, maternal, and permanent environmental effects experienced by an individual over its lifespan. Heritability of badge size was 0.33 with a significant estimate of underlying additive genetic variance. Body condition was strongly environmentally determined in this species and did not show either significant additive genetic variance or heritability. Neither badge size nor body condition was responsive to maternal effects. We propose that the lack of additive genetic variance and heritability of body condition makes it unlikely that genic capture mechanisms maintain additive genetic variance for badge size. That said, genic capture was originally proposed for male traits under female choice, not agonistic selection. If developmental pathways generating variance in body condition, and/or the covarying secondary sex trait, differ between inter- and intrasexual selection, or the rate at which their additive genetic variance or covariance is depleted, future work may show whether genic capture is largely restricted to intersexual selection processes.},

These splicing QTLs are major contributors to complex traits, roughly on a par with variants that affect gene expression levels.

Although synonymous mutations were previously thought to be silent, a large body of evidence has demonstrated that codon usage can play major roles in determining gene expression levels and protein structures. Codon usage influences translation elongation speed and regulates translation efficiency and accuracy. Adaptation of codon usage to tRNA expression determines the proteome landscape. In addition, codon usage biases result in nonuniform ribosome decoding rates on mRNAs, which in turn influence the cotranslational protein folding process that is critical for protein function in diverse biological processes. Conserved genome-wide correlations have also been found between codon usage and protein structures. Furthermore, codon usage is a major determinant of mRNA levels through translation-dependent effects on mRNA decay and translation-independent effects on transcriptional and posttranscriptional processes. Here, we discuss the multifaceted roles and mechanisms of codon usage in different gene regulatory processes.},

  abstract = {Broodiness in laying hens results in atrophy of the ovary and consequently decreases productivity. However, the regulatory mechanisms that drive ovary development remain elusive. Thus, we collected atrophic ovaries (AO) from 380-day-old broody chickens (BC) and normal ovaries (NO) from even-aged egg-laying hens (EH) for RNA sequencing. We identified 3,480 protein-coding transcripts that were differentially expressed (DE), including 1,719 that were down-regulated and 1,761 that were up-regulated in AO. There were 959 lncRNA transcripts that were DE, including 56 that were down-regulated and 903 that were up-regulated. Among the116 miRNAs that were DE, 79 were down-regulated and 37 were up-regulated in AO. Numerous DE protein-coding transcripts and target genes for miRNAs/lncRNAs were significantly enriched in reproductive processes, cell proliferation, and apoptosis pathways. A miRNA-intersection gene-pathway network was constructed by considering target relationships and correlation of the expression levels between ovary development-related genes and miRNAs. We also constructed a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network by integrating competing relationships between protein-coding genes and lncRNA transcripts, and identified several lncRNA transcripts predicted to regulate the CASP6, CYP1B1, GADD45, MMP2, and SMAS2 genes. In conclusion, we discovered protein-coding genes, miRNAs, and lncRNA transcripts that are candidate regulators of ovary development in broody chickens.},

  abstract = {Sexual selection is responsible for much of the spectacular natural diversity of mating traits. It is unclear, however, how this powerful evolutionary force affects the evolution of traits unrelated to mating. Four recent theoretical studies have argued that sexual selection might increase the rate of adaptation, but each relies on the assumption of a substantial positive covariance between male condition (non-mating fitness) and display. Here we demonstrate, with an explicit genetic model, that sexual selection itself can easily lead to the evolution and maintenance of this covariance. This process occurs through the evolution of conditiondependent male display and the resultant transfer of genetic variance for condition into variance in male display. We also track the effect of the covariance between condition and display on the rate of adaptation. Our results demonstrate a powerful synergy between natural and sexual selection that can elevate population mean fitness. Moreover, this synergy can greatly accelerate the rate of adaptation, making the feedback between natural and sexual selection a particularly potent force in changing environments. This has important implications for several key evolutionary processes, including the evolution of sex, sexual conflict and speciation.},

  abstract = {Respiration rate (RR) is a common measure of cattle health and welfare. Traditionally, measuring RR involves counting flank movements as the animal inhales and exhales with each breath. This method is often considered difficult, labour-intensive and impractical. We validated the use of infrared thermography (IRT) as an alternative method of non-invasively measuring RR in young calves. RR was simultaneously recorded in two ways: (1) by observing flank movements from video recordings; and (2) by observing thermal fluctuations around the nostrils during inhalations and exhalations from infrared recordings. For each method, the time taken to complete five consecutive breaths (a breath being a complete inhalation/exhalation cycle) was recorded and used to calculate RR (breaths/min). From a group of five calves, a total of 12 video recordings and 12 infrared recordings were collected. For each procedure, 47 sets of five consecutive breaths were assessed. The RRs measured from video recordings of flank movements and thermal fluctuations around the nostrils from infrared recordings were highly correlated (R2 = 0.93). Validated as a suitable method for recording RR, future research can now focus on the development of algorithms to automate the use of IRT to support its integration into existing automated systems to remotely monitor calf health and welfare.},

  abstract = {Temporal asymmetry in patterns of regional climate change may jeopardize the match between the proximate and ultimate cues of the timing of breeding. The consequences on short- and long-term population dynamics and trends as well as the underlying mechanisms are, however, often unknown. Using long-term data from Finland, we demonstrate that black grouse (               Tetrao tetrix               ) have responded to spring warming by advancing both egg-laying and hatching. However, early summer (the time of hatching) has not advanced, and chicks have to face colder post-hatching conditions. Demonstrating that these conditions are critical to post-hatching survival, we show that chicks are increasingly suffering higher mortality because they hatch too early. Consequently, breeding success and population size has severely declined over the past four decades. Finally, we modelled the impact of this particular climate change scenario on population dynamics and show that the mismatch can further explain the observed collapse of cyclic fluctuations. Because the evolutionary response of grouse is lagging behind the novel selective pressures, seasonally asymmetric climate change is likely to constitute an important determinant of future short- and long-term changes in the dynamics of black grouse populations.},

  abstract = {Background: Inbreeding depression can adversely affect traits related to fitness, reproduction and productive performance. Although current research suggests that inbreeding levels are generally low in most goat breeds, the impact of inbreeding depression on phenotypes of economic interest has only been investigated in a few studies based on genealogical data. Results: We genotyped 1040 goats with the Goat SNP50 BeadChip. This information was used to estimate different molecular inbreeding coefficients and characterise runs of homozygosity and homozygosity patterns. We detected 38 genomic regions with increased homozygosity as well as 8 ROH hotspots mapping to chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 6, 14, 16 and 17. Eight hundred seventeen goats with available records for dairy traits were analysed to evaluate the potential consequences of inbreeding depression on milk phenotypes. Four regions on chromosomes 8 and 25 were significantly associated with inbreeding depression for the natural logarithm of the somatic cell count. Notably, these regions contain several genes related with immunity, such as SYK, IL27, CCL19 and CCL21. Moreover, one region on chromosome 2 was significantly associated with inbreeding depression for milk yield. Conclusions: Although genomic inbreeding levels are low in Murciano-Granadina goats, significant evidence of inbreeding depression for the logarithm of the somatic cell count, a phenotype closely associated with udder health and milk yield, have been detected in this population. Minimising inbreeding would be expected to augment economic gain by increasing milk yield and reducing the incidence of mastitis, which is one of the main causes of dairy goat culling.},

  abstract = {It is important to detect population bottlenecks in threatened and managed species because bottlenecks can increase the risk of population extinction. Early detection is critical and can be facilitated by statistically powerful monitoring programs for detecting bottleneck-induced genetic change. We used Monte Carlo computer simulations to evaluate the power of the following tests for detecting genetic changes caused by a severe reduction in a population{\~O}s effective size (Ne): a test for loss of heterozygosity, two tests for loss of alleles, two tests for change in the distribution of allele frequencies, and a test for small Ne based on variance in allele frequencies (the {\^O}variance test{\~O}). The variance test was most powerful; it provided an 85\% probability of detecting a bottleneck of size Ne = 10 when monitoring five microsatellite loci and sampling 30 individuals both before and one generation after the bottleneck. The variance test was almost 10-times more powerful than a commonly used test for loss of heterozygosity, and it allowed for detection of bottlenecks before 5\% of a population{\~O}s heterozygosity had been lost. The second most powerful tests were generally the tests for loss of alleles. However, these tests had reduced power for detecting genetic bottlenecks caused by skewed sex ratios. We provide guidelines for the number of loci and individuals needed to achieve high-power tests when monitoring via the variance test. We also illustrate how the variance test performs when monitoring loci that have widely different allele frequency distributions as observed in five wild populations of mountain sheep (Ovis canadensis).},

This result may appear paradoxical, as inbreeding depression is thought to be caused mainly by the accumulation of mildly deleterious mutations (Charlesworth and Willis 2009), which are often only partially recessive (Crow and Simmons 1983; Barrett and Charlesworth 1991). Likewise in the bulb-mites, there is evidence for partially recessive alleles of small effect having a major contribution to inbreeding depression, as estimated from female fecundity effects (Radwan 2003b; Jarzebowska and Radwan 2010). If this is true then the accumulation of recessive alleles across multiple genetic loci should have negatively affected female fecundity more in S-lines that demonstrated greater evidence of inbreeding depression. The opposite pattern that we detected indicates that genes associated with expression of a costly weapon have a negative effect on female fitness, that is, cause gender load.},

Previous studies have suggested that life-history parameters, including longevity, may constrain the evolution of cooperative breeding. Here, we show that transitions to cooperative breeding across the mammalian phylogeny have been restricted to lineages where females produce multiple offspring per birth. We find no support for effects of longevity or of other life-history parameters.

While several studies have examined the genetic basis for parasite resistance, the role of epigenetics in the immune response to parasites is less understood. Yet, epigenetic modifications, such as changes in DNA methylation, may allow species to respond rapidly to parasite prevalence or virulence. To test the role of DNA methylation in relation to parasite infection, we examined genome-wide DNA methylation before and during infection by a parasitic nematode,               Syngamus trachea               , in a natural population of house sparrows (               Passer domesticus               ) using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). We found that DNA methylation levels were slightly lower in infected house sparrows, and we identified candidate genes relating to the initial immune response, activation of innate and adaptive immunity, and mucus membrane functional integrity that were differentially methylated between infected and control birds. Subsequently, we used methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting (MS-HRM) analyses to verify the relationship between methylation proportion and               S.~trachea               infection status at two candidate genes in a larger sample dataset. We found that methylation level at               NR1D1               , but not               CLDN22               , remained related to infection status and that juvenile recruitment probability was positively related to methylation level at               NR1D1               . This underscores the importance of performing follow-up studies on candidate genes. Our findings demonstrate that plasticity in the immune response to parasites can be epigenetically mediated and highlight the potential for epigenetic studies in natural populations to provide further mechanistic insight into host--parasite interactions.},

SOAPdenovo has been successfully applied to assemble many published genomes, but it still needs improvement in continuity, accuracy and coverage, especially in repeat regions. FINDINGS: To overcome these challenges, we have developed its successor, SOAPdenovo2, which has the advantage of a new algorithm design that reduces memory consumption in graph construction, resolves more repeat regions in contig assembly, increases coverage and length in scaffold construction, improves gap closing, and optimizes for large genome. CONCLUSIONS: Benchmark using the Assemblathon1 and GAGE datasets showed that SOAPdenovo2 greatly surpasses its predecessor SOAPdenovo and is competitive to other assemblers on both assembly length and accuracy. We also provide an updated assembly version of the 2008 Asian (YH) genome using SOAPdenovo2. Here, the contig and scaffold N50 of the YH genome were {\textasciitilde}20.9 kbp and {\textasciitilde}22 Mbp, respectively, which is 3-fold and 50-fold longer than the first published version. The genome coverage increased from 81.16\% to 93.91\%, and memory consumption was {\textasciitilde}2/3 lower during the point of largest memory consumption.},

Here, we explored women's participation in ecology conferences by analyzing female representation, behavior, and personal experience at the 1st Meeting of the Iberian Society of Ecology (SIBECOL). The conference had 722 attendees, 576 contributions, and 27 scientific sessions. The gender of attendees and presenters was balanced (48/52\% women/men), yet only 29\% of the contributions had a woman as last author. Moreover, men presented most of the keynote talks (67\%) and convened most of the sessions. Our results also showed that only 32\% of the questions were asked by women, yet the number of questions raised by women increased when the speaker or the convener was a woman. Finally, the post-conference survey revealed that attendees had a good experience and did not perceive the event as a threatening context for women. Yet, differences in the responses between genders suggest that women tended to have a worse experience than their male counterparts. Although our results showed clear gender biases, most of the participants of the conference failed to detect it. Overall, we highlight the challenge of increasing women's scientific leadership, visibility and interaction in scientific conferences and we suggest several recommendations for creating inclusive meetings, thereby promoting equal opportunities for all participants.},

  abstract = {In honey bees (Apis mellifera) the behaviorally and reproductively distinct queen and worker female castes derive from the same genome as a result of differential intake of royal jelly and are implemented in concert with DNA methylation. To determine if these very different diet-controlled phenotypes correlate with unique brain methylomes, we conducted a study to determine the methyl cytosine (mC) distribution in the brains of queens and workers at single-base-pair resolution using shotgun bisulfite sequencing technology. The whole-genome sequencing was validated by deep 454 sequencing of selected amplicons representing eight methylated genes. We found that nearly all mCs are located in CpG dinucleotides in the exons of 5,854 genes showing greater sequence conservation than non-methylated genes. Over 550 genes show significant methylation differences between queens and workers, revealing the intricate dynamics of methylation patterns. The distinctiveness of the differentially methylated genes is underscored by their intermediate CpG densities relative to drastically CpG-depleted methylated genes and to CpG-richer non-methylated genes. We find a strong correlation between methylation patterns and splicing sites including those that have the potential to generate alternative exons. We validate our genome-wide analyses by a detailed examination of two transcript variants encoded by one of the differentially methylated genes. The link between methylation and splicing is further supported by the differential methylation of genes belonging to the histone gene family. We propose that modulation of alternative splicing is one mechanism by which DNA methylation could be linked to gene regulation in the honey bee. Our study describes a level of molecular diversity previously unknown in honey bees that might be important for generating phenotypic flexibility not only during development but also in the adult post-mitotic brain.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity monitoring at the community scale is a critical element of assessing and studying species distributions, ecology, diversity, and movements, and it is key to understanding and tracking environmental and anthropogenic effects on natural ecosystems.1--4 Vertebrates in terrestrial ecosystems are experiencing extinctions and declines in both population numbers and sizes due to increasing threats from human activities and environmental change.5--8 Terrestrial vertebrate monitoring using existing methods is generally costly and laborious, and although environmental DNA (eDNA) is becoming the tool of choice to assess biodiversity, few sample types effectively capture terrestrial vertebrate diversity. We hypothesized that eDNA captured from air could allow straightforward collection and characterization of terrestrial vertebrate communities. We filtered air at three localities in the Copenhagen Zoo: a stable, outside between the outdoor enclosures, and in the Rainforest House. Through metabarcoding of airborne eDNA, we detected 49 vertebrate species spanning 26 orders and 37 families: 30 mammal, 13 bird, 4 fish, 1 amphibian, and 1 reptile species. These spanned animals kept at the zoo, species occurring in the zoo surroundings, and species used as feed in the zoo. The detected species comprise a range of taxonomic orders and families, sizes, behaviors, and abundances. We found shorter distance to the air sampling device and higher animal biomass to increase the probability of detection. We hereby show that airborne eDNA can offer a fundamentally new way of studying and monitoring terrestrial communities.},

  abstract = {Wate rbird hunting is a widesp read activity in wetlands throughout Europe and constitutes one of the most significant sources of disturbance during autumn and winter. The biological evidence for effects of hunting disturbance on the behavio ur and distribution of migratory and wintering waterbirds and its possible impacts on population dynamics is reviewed. Most of the literature has been concerned with local effects of disturbance , focussing on quarry geese and dabbling ducks. Co mparatively little is known about effects on diving ducks and waders, while there is no direct evidence for impacts at the population level for any waterbird species . Hunting disturba nce can cause temporary disruption of normal activities of waterbirds, alter their diurnal rhythms and increase escape flight distances. It can displace waterbirds from preferred feeding and roosting habitats at local or regio nal level and increase turnover, so that the carryi ng capacity of a site is not reached. Quarry waterbirds, and those occurri ng in large inshore concentra tions, such as many dabbling ducks, geese and waders, are potentially most sensi"tive to disturbance. Hunting disturbance can disrupt pair-bonds and family structures which may affec t reproduc tive output. Evide nce is provided that many waterbird populations are limited by winter conditions and that the majority of studied waterbird species lose body reserve s during winter. Because hunting disturbance causes under-exploitation of potential feeding grounds where population limitation is considered to occu r, such disturbance will, by definition, have an impact at the population level. However, the magnitude of this impact has not been quantified and requires a modelling approac h.},

Epigenetic regulation, such as DNA methylation, has been hypothesized as a potential mechanism to mediate such effects, yet studies in wild species are lacking. We first investigated the effects of early-life exposure to the heavy metal lead (Pb) on DNA methylation levels in a wild population of great tits (Parus major), by experimentally exposing nestlings to Pb at environmentally relevant levels. Secondly, we compared nestling DNA methylation from a population exposed to long-term heavy metal pollution (close to a copper smelter), where birds suffer from pollution-related decrease in food quality, and a control population. For both comparisons, the analysis of about one million CpGs covering most of the annotated genes revealed that pollution-related changes in DNA methylation were not genome wide, but enriched for genes underlying developmental processes. However, the results were not consistent when using binomial or beta binomial regression highlighting the difficulty of modelling variance in CpGs. Our study indicates that post-natal anthropogenic heavy metal exposure can affect methylation levels of development related genes in a wild bird population.},

DNA methylation is known to affect timing of reproduction in various organisms and is therefore a potential mechanism also in birds. Here we describe genome wide data aiming to detect temporal changes in methylation in relation to timing of breeding using artificial selection lines of great tits (               Parus major               ) exposed to contrasting temperature treatments. Methylation levels of DNA extracted from erythrocytes were examined using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). In total, we obtained sequencing data from 63 libraries over four different time points from 16 birds with on average 20 million quality filtered reads per library. These data describe individual level temporal variation in DNA methylation throughout the breeding season under experimental temperature regimes and provides a resource for future studies investigating the role of temporal changes in DNA methylation in timing of reproduction.},

  abstract = {Among polar bears (Ursus maritimus), fitness is dependent on body size through males' abilities to win mates, females' abilities to provide for their young and all bears' abilities to survive increasingly longer fasting periods caused by climate change. In the Western Hudson Bay subpopulation (near Churchill, Manitoba, Canada), polar bears have declined in body size and condition, but nothing is known about the genetic underpinnings of body size variation, which may be subject to natural selection. Here, we combine a 4449-individual pedigree and an array of 5,433 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to provide the first quantitative genetic study of polar bears. We used animal models to estimate heritability (h2) among polar bears handled between 1966 and 2011, obtaining h2 estimates of 0.34--0.48 for strictly skeletal traits and 0.18 for axillary girth (which is also dependent on fatness). We genotyped 859 individuals with the SNP array to test for marker--trait association and combined p-values over genetic pathways using geneset analysis. Variation in all traits appeared to be polygenic, but we detected one region of moderately large effect size in body length near a putative noncoding RNA in an unannotated region of the genome. Gene-set analysis suggested that variation in body length was associated with genes in the regulatory cascade of cyclin expression, which has previously been associated with body size in mice. A greater understanding of the genetic architecture of body size variation will be valuable in understanding the potential for adaptation in polar bear populations challenged by climate change.},

Accurate specification of familial relationships is crucial for family-based GWAS, as well as in population-based GWAS with unknown (or unrecognized) family structure. The family structure in a GWAS should be routinely investigated using the SNP data prior to the analysis of population structure or phenotype. Existing algorithms for relationship inference have a major weakness of estimating allele frequencies at each SNP from the entire sample, under a strong assumption of homogeneous population structure. This assumption is often untenable.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Deleterious mutations tend to be recessive. Several theories, notably those of Fisher (based on selection) and Wright (based on metabolism), have been put forward to explain this pattern. Despite a long-lasting debate, the matter remains unresolved. This debate has focused on the average dominance of mutations. However, we also know very little about the distribution of dominance coefficients among mutations, and about its variation across environments. In this article we present a new approach to predicting this distribution. Our approach is based on a phenotypic fitness landscape model. First, we show that under a very broad range of conditions (and environments), the average dominance of mutation of small effects should be approximately one-quarter as long as adaptation of organisms to their environment can be well described by stabilizing selection on an arbitrary set of phenotypic traits. Second, the theory allows predicting the whole distribution of dominance coefficients among mutants. Because it provides quantitative rather than qualitative predictions, this theory can be directly compared to data. We found that its prediction on mean dominance (average dominance close to 0.25) agreed well with the data, based on a meta-analysis of dominance data for mildly deleterious mutations. However, a simple landscape model does not account for the dominance of mutations of large effects and we provide possible extension of the theory for this class of mutations. Because dominance is a central parameter for evolutionary theory, and because these predictions are quantitative, they set the stage for a wide range of applications and further empirical tests.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Phenotypic plasticity is the production of multiple phenotypes from a single genome and is notably observed in social insects. Multiple epigenetic mechanisms have been associated with social insect plasticity, with DNA methylation being explored to the greatest extent. DNA methylation is thought to play a role in caste determination in Apis mellifera, and other social insects, but there is limited knowledge on its role in other bee species. In this study, we analyzed whole genome bisulfite sequencing and RNA-seq data sets from head tissue of reproductive and sterile castes of the eusocial bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We found that genome-wide methylation in B. terrestris is similar to other holometabolous insects and does not differ between reproductive castes. We did, however, find differentially methylated genes between castes, which are enriched for multiple biological processes including reproduction. However, we found no relationship between differential methylation and differential gene expression or differential exon usage between castes. Our results also indicate high intercolony variation in methylation. These findings suggest that methylation is associated with caste differences but may serve an alternate function, other than direct caste determination in this species. This study provides the first insights into the nature of a bumblebee caste-specific methylome as well as its interaction with gene expression and caste-specific alternative splicing, providing greater understanding of the role of methylation in phenotypic plasticity within social bee species. Future experimental work is needed to determine the function of methylation and other epigenetic mechanisms in~insects.},

  abstract = {Structural variation (copy number variation [CNV] including deletion and duplication, translocation, inversion) of chromosomes has been identified in some individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but the full etiologic role is unknown. We performed genome-wide assessment for structural abnormalities in 427 unrelated ASD cases via single-nucleotide polymorphism microarrays and karyotyping. With microarrays, we discovered 277 unbalanced CNVs in 44\% of ASD families not present in 500 controls (and re-examined in another 1152 controls). Karyotyping detected additional balanced changes. Although most variants were inherited, we found a total of 27 cases with de novo alterations, and in three (11\%) of these individuals, two or more new variants were observed. De novo CNVs were found in {$\sim$}7\% and {$\sim$}2\% of idiopathic families having one child, or two or more ASD siblings, respectively. We also detected 13 loci with recurrent/overlapping CNV in unrelated cases, and at these sites, deletions and duplications affecting the same gene(s) in different individuals and sometimes in asymptomatic carriers were also found. Notwithstanding complexities, our results further implicate the SHANK3-NLGN4-NRXN1 postsynaptic density genes and also identify novel loci at DPP6-DPP10-PCDH9 (synapse complex), ANKRD11, DPYD, PTCHD1, 15q24, among others, for a role in ASD susceptibility. Our most compelling result discovered CNV at 16p11.2 (p = 0.002) (with characteristics of a genomic disorder) at {$\sim$}1\% frequency. Some of the ASD regions were also common to mental retardation loci. Structural variants were found in sufficiently high frequency influencing ASD to suggest that cytogenetic and microarray analyses be considered in routine clinical workup.},

Across island systems, contemporary patterns of genetic diversity reflect population demography, including colonization events, bottlenecks, gene flow and genetic drift. Here, we investigate genome-wide diversity and the distribution of runs of homozygosity (ROH) using whole-genome resequencing of individuals ({$>$}22{\texttimes} coverage) from six populations across three archipelagos of Berthelot's pipit (               Anthus berthelotii               )-a passerine that has recently undergone island speciation. We show the most dramatic reduction in diversity occurs between the mainland sister species (the tawny pipit) and Berthelot's pipit and is lowest in the populations that have experienced sequential bottlenecks (i.e., the Madeiran and Selvagens populations). Pairwise sequential Markovian coalescent (PSMC) analyses estimated that Berthelot's pipit diverged from its sister species {\textasciitilde}2 million years ago, with the Madeiran archipelago founded 50,000\,years ago, and the Selvagens colonized 8000\,years ago. We identify many long ROH ({$>$}1~Mb) in these most recently colonized populations. Population expansion within the last 100\,years may have eroded long ROH in the Madeiran archipelago, resulting in a prevalence of short ROH ({$<$}1~Mb). However, the extensive long and short ROH detected in the Selvagens suggest strong recent inbreeding and bottleneck effects, with as much as 38\% of the autosomes consisting of ROH\,{$>$}250\,kb. These findings highlight the importance of demographic history, as well as selection and genetic drift, in shaping contemporary patterns of genomic diversity across diverging populations.},

Runs of homozygosity (ROH) are contiguous lengths of homozygous segments of the genome where the two haplotypes inherited from the parents are identical. Here, we investigated the occurrence and distribution of ROH using a medium-dense SNP panel to characterize autozygosity in 516 Valle del Belice sheep and to identify the genomic regions with high ROH frequencies. Results:{\enspace} We identified 11,629 ROH and all individuals displayed at least one ROH longer than 1 Mb. The mean value of F estimated from ROH longer than1 Mb was 0.084 {\textpm} 0.061. ROH that were shorter than 10 Mb predominated. The highest and lowest coverages of Ovis aries chromosomes (OAR) by ROH were on OAR24 and OAR1, respectively. The number of ROH per chromosome length displayed a specific pattern, with higher values for the first three chromosomes. Both number of ROH and length of the genome covered by ROH varied considerably between animals. Two hundred and thirty-nine SNPs were considered as candidate markers that may be under directional selection and we identified 107 potential candidate genes. Six genomic regions located on six chromosomes, corresponding to ROH islands, are presented as hotspots of autozygosity, which frequently coincided with regions of medium recombination rate. According to the KEGG database, most of these genes were involved in multiple signaling and signal transduction pathways in a wide variety of cellular and biochemical processes. A genome scan revealed the presence of ROH islands in genomic regions that harbor candidate genes for selection in response to environmental stress and which underlie local adaptation. Conclusions:{\enspace} These results suggest that natural selection has, at least partially, a role in shaping the genome of Valle del Belice sheep and that ROH in the ovine genome may help to detect genomic regions involved in the determinism of traits under selection.},

However, functional links between mCG and other epigenetic mechanisms in vivo remain obscure. Using successive generations of an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant deficient in maintaining mCG, we find that mCG loss triggers genome-wide activation of alternative epigenetic mechanisms. However, these mechanisms, which involve RNA-directed DNA methylation, inhibiting expression of DNA demethylases, and retargeting of histone H3K9 methylation, act in a stochastic and uncoordinated fashion. As a result, new and aberrant epigenetic patterns are progressively formed over several plant generations in the absence of mCG. Interestingly, the unconventional redistribution of epigenetic marks is necessary to ``rescue'' the loss of mCG, since mutant plants impaired in rescue activities are severely dwarfed and sterile. Our results provide evidence that mCG is a central coordinator of epigenetic memory that secures stable transgenerational inheritance in plants.},

We are interested in how the variation captured in protein-\-coding genes fluctuates relative to overall genomic diversity and whether smaller populations suffer greater costs due to their genetic load of deleterious mutations compared with larger populations. We analyzed individual whole-\-genome sequences (N = 74) from three different populations of Montezuma quail (Cyrtonyx montezumae), a small ground-\-dwelling bird that is sustainably harvested in some portions of its range but is of conservation concern elsewhere. Our historical demographic results indicate that Montezuma quail populations in the United States exhibit low levels of genomic diversity due in large part to long-\-term declines in effective population sizes over nearly a million years. The smaller and more isolated Texas population is significantly more inbred than the large Arizona and the intermediate-\-sized New Mexico populations we surveyed. The Texas gene pool has a significantly smaller proportion of strongly deleterious variants segregating in the population compared with the larger Arizona gene pool. Our results demonstrate that even in small populations, highly deleterious mutations are effectively purged and/or lost due to drift. However, we find that in small populations the realized genetic load is elevated because of inbreeding coupled with a higher frequency of slightly deleterious mutations that are manifested in homozygotes. Overall, our study illustrates how population genomics can be used to proactively assess both neutral and functional aspects of contemporary genetic diversity in a conservation framework while simultaneously considering deeper demographic histories.},

  abstract = {Synopsis             The concept of trade-offs permeates our thinking about adaptive evolution because they are exhibited at every level of biological organization, from molecular and cellular processes to organismal and ecological functions. Trade-offs inevitably arise because different traits do not occur in isolation, but instead are imbedded within complex, integrated systems that make up whole organisms. The genetic and mechanistic underpinning of trade-offs can be found in the pleiotropic nodes that occur in the biological pathways shared between traits. Yet, often trade-offs are only understood as statistical correlations, limiting the ability to evaluate the interplay between how selection and constraint interact during adaptive evolution. Here, we first review the classic paradigms in which physiologists and evolutionary biologists have studied trade-offs and highlight the ways in which network and molecular pathway approaches unify these paradigms. We discuss how these approaches allow researchers to evaluate why trade-offs arise and how selection can act to overcome trait correlations and evolutionary constraints. We argue that understanding how the conserved molecular pathways are shared between different traits and functions provides a conceptual framework for evolutionary biologists, physiologists, and molecular biologists to meaningfully work together toward the goal of understanding why correlations and trade-offs occur between traits. We briefly highlight the melanocortin system and the hormonal control of osmoregulation as two case studies where an understanding of shared molecular pathways reveals why trade-offs occur between seemingly unrelated traits. While we recognize that applying such approaches poses challenges and limitations particularly in the context of natural populations, we advocate for the view that focusing on the biological pathways responsible for trade-offs provides a unified conceptual context accessible to a broad range of integrative biologists.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                        Many species are threatened by climate change and must rapidly respond to survive changing environments. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, can facilitate plastic responses by regulating gene expression in response to environmental cues. Understanding epigenetic responses is therefore essential for predicting species' ability to rapidly adapt in the context of global environmental change. Here, we investigated the functional significance of DNA methylation on temperature-dependent life history in seed beetles,             Callosobruchus maculatus             . We assessed changes in DNA methyltransferase (             Dnmt1             and             Dnmt2             ) expression levels under ambient conditions and thermal stress, and reproductive performance following artificially-induced epimutation via 3-aminobenzamide (3AB) and Zebularine (Zeb), at a range of ambient and warmer temperatures over two generations. We found that             Dnmt1             and             Dnmt2             were greatly expressed in females, throughout the body, and exhibited temperature-dependence; in contrast,             Dnmt             expression was minimal in males. Epimutation led to shifts in female reproductive life history trade-off allocation, and differentially altered thermal optima of fecundity and offspring viability. This study revealed the optimal allocation strategy among these fitness components is temperature-dependent, and trade-offs become increasingly difficult to resolve epigenetically under more extreme warming. Results suggest that epigenetic mechanisms are strongly implicated in, and perhaps limiting of, invertebrate life history responses to temperature change. Further investigation will reveal targeted DNA methylation patterns and specific loci associated with temperature-dependent life history trade-offs in seed beetles and other invertebrates.},

Here we focus on characterizing the genetic perturbations that accompany and may contribute to neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Specifically, we examine two types of structural variants, namely, copy number variation and balanced chromosome rearrangements, discovered in subjects with neurodevelopmental disorders and related phenotypes. We find that a feature uniting these types of genetic aberrations is a proximity to ultraconserved elements (UCEs), which are sequences that are perfectly conserved between the reference genomes of distantly related species. In particular, while UCEs are generally depleted from copy number variant regions in healthy individuals, they are, on the whole, enriched in genomic regions disrupted by copy number variants or breakpoints of balanced rearrangements in affected individuals. Additionally, while genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders are enriched in UCEs, this does not account for the excess of UCEs either in copy number variants or close to the breakpoints of balanced rearrangements in affected individuals. Indeed, our data are consistent with some manifestations of neurodevelopmental disorders resulting from a disruption of genome integrity in the vicinity of UCEs.},

Based on this principle, genomic prediction methods are used to make predictions of breeding value for an individual using genome-wide molecular markers. In breeding, genomic prediction models have been used in plant and animal breeding for almost two decades to increase rates of genetic improvement and reduce the length of artificial selection experiments. However, evolutionary genomics studies have been slow to incorporate this technique to select individuals for breeding in a conservation context or to learn more about the genetic architecture of traits, the genetic value of missing individuals or microevolution of breeding values. Here, we outline the utility of genomic prediction and provide an overview of the methodology. We highlight opportunities to apply genomic prediction in evolutionary genetics of wild populations and the best practices when using these methods on field-collected phenotypes.},

However, whether these parental effects impact offspring fitness in nature is often unclear. In addition, despite evidence that maternal care can influence offspring behaviour via epigenetic alterations to the genome, it remains unclear whether paternal care has similar effects. Here, we show in three-spined sticklebacks, a fish in which fathers are the sole provider of offspring care, that the direct care provided by fathers affects offspring anxiety and the potential for epigenetic alterations to the offspring genome. We find that families are differentially vulnerable to early stress and fathers can compensate for this differential sensitivity with the quality of their care. This variation in paternal care is also linked to the expression in offspring brains of a DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt3a) responsible for de novo methylation. We show that these paternal effects are potentially adaptive and anxious offspring are unlikely to survive an encounter with a predator. By supplying offspring care, fathers reduce offspring anxiety thereby increasing the survival of their offspring---not in the traditional sense through resource provisioning but through an epigenetic effect on offspring behavioural development.},

There are many initiatives which are used to attempt to address these biases and stereotypes, including the use of visible role models. This study explores the perceptions of the stereotypes applied to female STEM professionals who publicly speak about their work in both academic and non-academic settings. Using workshops with over 300 participants, predominantly female STEM professionals, from over 25 different cultural backgrounds, the results showed women who publicly communicate their work are likely to be stereotyped as `bitchy', `bossy', and `emotional'---often by their own gender. These findings suggest that women may be in a more vulnerable position when communicating publicly about their work, which could have implications for them participating fully in their careers. It may also have implications for programs which use role models to address prevailing STEM stereotypes. Systematic cultural and institutional change is needed in STEM fields to address the underlying bias and negative stereotypes facing women. However, it should be ensured that the intended solutions to facilitate this change are not compounding the problem.},

There is a need for the real-time systematic detection and control of disease in animals in order to limit the impact on animal welfare and food supply. Diseases such as footrot and mastitis cause significant pain in sheep, and so early detection is vital to ensuring effective treatment and preventing the spread across the flock. Facial expression scoring to assess pain in humans and non-humans is now well utilized, and the Sheep Pain Facial Expression Scale (SPFES) is a tool that can reliably detect pain in this species. The SPFES currently requires manual scoring, leaving it open to observer bias, and it is also time-consuming. The ability of a computer to automatically detect and direct a producer as to where assessment and treatment are needed would increase the chances of controlling the spread of disease. It would also aid in the prevention of resistance across the individual, farm, and landscape at both national and international levels. In this paper, we present our framework for an integrated novel system based on techniques originally applied for human facial expression recognition that could be implemented at the farm level. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that this technology has been applied to sheep to assess pain.},

Low status individuals receive more antagonistic encounters, have fewer supportive relationships and have worse health outcomes. However, the physiological and cellular processes that mediate the relationship between the social environment and health are incompletely known. Epigenetic regulation of the hypothalamic--pituitary--adrenal (HPA) axis, the neuroendocrine pathway that activates in response to stressors, may be one process that is sensitive to the social environment. Here, we experimentally manipulated plumage, a key social signal in female tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) and quantified methylation of four genes in the HPA axis before and after treatment. We found that dulling the white breast plumage affected methylation in one gene, CRHR1; however, the effect depended on the original brightness of the bird. Methylation in this gene was correlated with baseline corticosterone levels, suggesting that DNA methylation of CRHR1 helps regulate glucocorticoid production in this species. Methylation in two other genes, FKBP5 and GR, changed over the course of the experiment, independent of treatment. These results show that methylation of these genes is labile into adulthood and suggest that epigenetic regulation of the HPA axis could help birds respond to current environmental conditions.},

The genetic heritability of DNA methylation has been estimated using twin pairs, although concern has been expressed whether the underlying assumption of equal common environmental effects are applicable due to intrauterine differences between monozygotic and dizygotic twins. We estimate the heritability of DNA methylation on peripheral blood leukocytes using Illumina HumanMethylation450 array using a family based sample of 614 people from 117 families, allowing comparison both within and across generations. Results: The correlations from the various available relative pairs indicate that on average the similarity in DNA methylation between relatives is predominantly due to genetic effects with any common environmental or zygotic effects being limited. The average heritability of DNA methylation measured at probes with no known SNPs is estimated as 0.187. The ten most heritable methylation probes were investigated with a genome-wide association study, all showing highly statistically significant cis mQTLs. Further investigation of one of these cis mQTL, found in the MHC region of chromosome 6, showed the most significantly associated SNP was also associated with over 200 other DNA methylation probes in this region and the gene expression level of 9 genes. Conclusions: The majority of transgenerational similarity in DNA methylation is attributable to genetic effects, and approximately 20\% of individual differences in DNA methylation in the population are caused by DNA sequence variation that is not located within CpG sites.},

However, the consequences of inbreeding on long-term survival and reproductive success (Darwinian fitness) are uncertain for vertebrates in the wild.

We compared the fitness of inbred (from full-sib matings) and outbred wild house mice (               Mus domesticus               ) in large, seminatural enclosures. Inbred males sired only one-fifth as many surviving offspring as outbred males because of their poor competitive ability and survivorship. In laboratory conditions, inbreeding had relatively minor effects on male reproductive success and no effect on survivorship. Seminatural conditions did not increase inbreeding depression for females, probably because females were not competing for any critical resources. The overall reduction in fitness from inbreeding was 57\%, which is 4.5 times as great as previous estimates from the laboratory. These results have important implications for medicine, conservation, evolutionary biology, and functional genomics.},

We 1) performed a systematic literature review of EWAS of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)- and aggression-related behaviours conducted in peripheral tissue and cord blood and 2) combined the most strongly associated DNAm sites observed in individual studies (p {$<$} 10-3) to identify candidate genes and biological systems for ADHD and aggressive behaviours. We observed enrichment for neuronal processes and neuronal cell marker genes for ADHD. Astrocyte and granulocytes cell markers among genes annotated to DNAm sites were relevant for both ADHD and aggression-related behaviours. Only 1 \% of the most significant epigenetic findings for ADHD/ADHD symptoms were likely to be directly explained by genetic factors involved in ADHD. Finally, we discuss how the field would greatly benefit from larger sample sizes and harmonization of assessment instruments.},

  abstract = {A better understanding of animal emotion is an important goal in disciplines ranging from neuroscience to animal welfare science. The conscious experience of emotion cannot be assessed directly, but neural, behavioural and physiological indicators of emotion can be measured. Researchers have used these measures to characterize how animals respond to situations assumed to induce discrete emotional states (e.g. fear). While advancing our understanding of specific emotions, this discrete emotion approach lacks an overarching framework that can incorporate and integrate the wide range of possible emotional states. Dimensional approaches that conceptualize emotions in terms of universal core affective characteristics (e.g. valence (positivity versus negativity) and arousal) can provide such a framework. Here, we bring together discrete and dimensional approaches to: (i) offer a structure for integrating different discrete emotions that provides a functional perspective on the adaptive value of emotional states, (ii) suggest how long-term mood states arise from short-term discrete emotions, how they also influence these discrete emotions through a bi-directional relationship and how they may function to guide decision-making, and (iii) generate novel hypothesis-driven measures of animal emotion and mood.},

Oxidative stress affects female and male gametes and the developmental capacity of embryos. Its effect can continue through late stages of pregnancy. Metabolic disorders and psychiatric problems can also be caued by DNA methylation and epigenetic errors. Age has a negative effect on oxidative stress and DNA methylation, and recent observations suggest that older men are at risk of transmitting epigenetic disorders to their offspring. Environmental endocrine disruptors can also increase oxidative stress and methylation errors. Oxidative stress and DNA methylation feature a common denominator: the one carbon cycle. This important metabolic pathway stimulates glutathione synthesis and recycles homocysteine, a molecule that interferes with the process of methylation. Glutathione plays a pivotal role during oocyte activation, protecting against reactive oxygen species. Assisted reproductive techniques may exacerbate defects in methylation and epigenesis. Antioxidant supplements are proposed to reduce the risk of potentially harmful effects, but their use has failed to prevent problems and may sometimes be detrimental. New concepts reveal a significant correlation between oxidative stress, methylation processes and epigenesis, and have led to changes in media composition with positive preliminary clinical consequences.},

  abstract = {Migration is a complex behavioural adaptation for survival that has evolved across the animal kingdom from invertebrates to mammals. In some taxa, closely related migratory species, or even populations of the same species, exhibit different migratory phenotypes, including timing and orientation of migration. In these species, a significant proportion of the phenotypic variance in migratory traits is genetic. In others, the migratory phenotype and direction is triggered by seasonal changes in the environment, suggesting an epigenetic control of their migration. The genes and epigenetic changes underpinning migratory behaviour remain largely unknown. The revolution in (epi)genomics and functional genomic tools holds great promise to rapidly move the field of migration genetics forward. Here, we review our current understanding of the genetic and epigenetic architecture of migratory traits, focusing on two emerging models: the European blackcap and the North American monarch butterfly. We also outline a vision of how technical advances and integrative approaches could be employed to identify and functionally validate candidate genes and cisregulatory elements on these and other migratory species across both small and broad phylogenetic scales to significantly advance the field of genetics of animal migration.},

A key challenge is to identify such signatures in wild organisms, particularly between populations of highly mobile species that undergo substantial gene flow. The Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) is one species where mainland populations appear largely undifferentiated at traditional genetic markers, despite inhabiting diverse environments and displaying phenotypic variation. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing to investigate both neutral genetic structure and epigenetic differentiation across the distributional range of Canada lynx. Newfoundland lynx were identified as the most differentiated population at neutral genetic markers, with demographic modelling suggesting that divergence from the mainland occurred at the end of the last glaciation (20--33 KYA). In contrast, epigenetic structure revealed hidden levels of differentiation across the range coincident with environmental determinants including winter conditions, particularly in the peripheral Newfoundland and Alaskan populations. Several biological pathways related to morphology were differentially methylated between populations, suggesting that epigenetic modifications might explain morphological differences seen between geographically peripheral populations. Our results indicate that epigenetic modifications, specifically DNA methylation, are powerful markers to investigate population differentiation in wild and non-model systems.},

  abstract = {Background: PLINK is probably the most used program for analyzing SNP genotypes and runs of homozygosity (ROH), both in human and in animal populations. The last decade, ROH analyses have become the state-of-the-art method for inbreeding assessment. In PLINK, the --homozyg function is used to perform ROH analyses and relies on several input settings. These settings can have a large impact on the outcome and default values are not always appropriate for medium density SNP array data. Guidelines for a robust and uniform ROH analysis in PLINK using medium density data are lacking, albeit these guidelines are vital for comparing different ROH studies. In this study, 8 populations of different livestock and pet species are used to demonstrate the importance of PLINK input settings. Moreover, the effects of pruning SNPs for low minor allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium on ROH detection are shown. Results: We introduce the genome coverage parameter to appropriately estimate FROH and to check the validity of ROH analyses. The effect of pruning for linkage disequilibrium and low minor allele frequencies on ROH analyses is highly population dependent and such pruning may result in missed ROH. PLINK's minimal density requirement is crucial for medium density genotypes and if set too low, genome coverage of the ROH analysis is limited. Finally, we provide recommendations for the maximal gap, scanning window length and threshold settings. Conclusions: In this study, we present guidelines for an adequate and robust ROH analysis in PLINK on medium density SNP data. Furthermore, we advise to report parameter settings in publications, and to validate them prior to analysis. Moreover, we encourage authors to report genome coverage to reflect the ROH analysis' validity. Implementing these guidelines will substantially improve the overall quality and uniformity of ROH analyses.},

The research group included 100 athletes (mean age = 22.88, SD = 6.35), whereas the control group were 239 healthy male volunteers matched for age (mean age = 21.69, SD = 3.39). Both, the control and the research group, included individuals with Caucasian origin from the same region of Poland. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes using a DNA isolation kit (A\&A Biotechnology, Gdynia, Poland). Bisulfite modification of 250 ng DNA was performed using the EZ DNA Methylation Kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA, USA), according to manufacturer's instructions. The methylation-specific PCR assay was carried out in a Mastercycler epgradient S (Eppendorf, Germany). We observed that the level of general methylation of the CpG island was similar for both groups. Further exploration of individual CpG sites allowed to notice that there were significant differences in methylation status in specific positions. Nonetheless, there was no rule that would indicate either higher or lower methylation of individual sites, four of them were methylated at a higher level (positions 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 23, 25, 26, 27, 29 and 30), while one showed an inverse trend (position 3). More precise analysis with the usage of Bonferroni correction for multiple tests indicated that differences in CpG site methylation were mainly increased in several positions and decreased in position 3.},

During a mammal's lifecycle epigenetic reprogramming, or the resetting of most epigenetic marks, occurs twice. The first instance of reprogramming occurs in primordial germ cells and the second occurs following fertilization. These processes may be both passive and active. In order for epigenetic inheritance to occur the epigenetic modifications must be able to escape reprogramming.There are several examples supporting this non-Mendelian mechanism of inheritance including the prepacking of early developmental genes in histones instead of protamines in sperm, genomic imprinting via methylation marks, the retention of CenH3 in mammalian sperm and the inheritance of piwi-associated interfering RNAs.The ability of mammals to pass on epigenetic information to their progeny provides clear evidence that inheritance is not restricted to DNA sequence and epigenetics plays a key role in producing viable offspring.},

  abstract = {Females often prefer males with elaborate traits, even when they receive no direct benefits from their choice. In such situations, mate discrimination presumably has genetic advantages; selective females will produce offspring of higher genetic quality. Over time, persistent female preferences for elaborate secondary-sexual traits in males should erode genetic variance in these traits, eventually eliminating any benefit to the preferences. Yet, strong female preferences persist in many taxa. This puzzle is called the lek paradox and raises two primary questions: do females obtain genetic benefits for offspring by selecting males with elaborate secondary-sexual characteristics and, if so, how is the genetic variation in these male traits maintained? We suggest that indirect genetic effects may help to resolve the lek paradox. Maternal phenotypes, such as habitat selection behaviours and offspring provisioning, often influence the condition and the expression of secondary-sexual traits in sons. These maternal influences are commonly genetic based (i.e. they are indirect genetic effects). Females choosing mates with elaborate traits may receive `good genes' for daughters in the form of effective maternal characteristics. Recognizing the significance of indirect genetic effects may be important to our understanding of the process and consequences of sexual selection.},

  abstract = {Selective harvesting regimes are often implemented because age and sex classes contribute differently to population dynamics and hunters show preferences associated with body size and trophy value. We reviewed the literature on how such cropping regimes affect the demography of the remaining population (here termed demographic side effects ). First, we examined the implications of removing a large proportion of a specific age or sex class. Such harvesting strategies often bias the population sex ratio toward females and reduce the mean age of males, which may consequently delay birth dates, reduce birth synchrony, delay body mass development, and alter offspring sex ratios. Second, we reviewed the side effects associated with the selective removal of relatively few specific individuals, often large trophy males. Such selective harvesting can destabilize social structures and the dominance hierarchy and may cause loss of social knowledge, sexually selected infanticide, habitat changes among reproductive females, and changes in offspring sex ratio. A common feature of many of the reported mechanisms is that they ultimately depress recruitment and in some extreme cases even cause total reproductive collapse. These effects could act additively and destabilize the dynamics of populations, thus having a stronger effect on population growth rate than first anticipated. Although more experimental than observational studies reported demographic side effects, we argue that this may reflect the quite subtle mechanisms involved, which are unlikely to be detected in observational studies without rigorous monitoring regimes. We call for more detailed studies of hunted populations with marked individuals that address how the expression of these effects varies across mating systems, habitats, and with population density. Theoretical models investigating how strongly these effects influence population growth rates are also required.},

In birds, yolk corticosterone (CORT) influences development by impacting pre- and postnatal growth, as well as nestling stress responses and development. One possible mechanism through which maternal CORT may affect offspring development is via changes to offspring DNA methylation. We sought to investigate this, for the first time in birds, by quantifying the impact of manipulations to maternal CORT on offspring DNA methylation. We non-invasively manipulated plasma CORT concentrations of egg-laying female zebra finches (               Taeniopygia castanotis               ) with an acute dose of CORT administered around the time of ovulation and collected their eggs. We then assessed DNA methylation in the resulting embryonic tissue and in their associated vitelline membrane blood vessels, during early development (5\,days after lay), using two established methods -- liquid chromatography--mass spectrometry (LC--MS) and methylation-sensitive amplification fragment length polymorphism (MS-AFLP). LC--MS analysis showed that global DNA methylation was lower in embryos from CORT-treated mothers, compared to control embryos. In contrast, blood vessel DNA from eggs from CORT-treated mothers showed global methylation increases, compared to control samples. There was a higher proportion of global DNA methylation in the embryonic DNA of second clutches, compared to first clutches. Locus-specific analyses using MS-AFLP did not reveal a treatment effect. Our results indicate that an acute elevation of maternal CORT around ovulation impacts DNA methylation patterns in their offspring. This could provide a mechanistic understanding of how a mother's experience can affect her offspring's phenotype.},

  abstract = {Hunting remains the cornerstone of the North American model of wildlife conservation and management. Nevertheless, research has indicated the potential for hunting to adversely influence size of horn-like structures of some ungulates. In polygynous ungulates, mating success of males is strongly correlated with body size and size of horn-like structures; consequently, sexual selection has favored the development of large horns and antlers. Horn-like structures are biologically important and are of great cultural interest, both of which highlight the need to identify long-term trends in size of those structures, and understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for such trends. We evaluated trends in horn and antler size of trophy males (individuals exhibiting exceptionally large horns or antlers) recorded from 1900 to 2008 in Records of North American Big Game, which comprised {$>$}22,000 records among 25 trophy categories encompassing the geographic extent of species occupying North America. The long-term and broad-scale nature of those data neutralized localized effects of climate and population dynamics, making it possible to detect meaningful changes in size of horn-like structures among trophy males over the past century; however, ages of individual specimens were not available, which prevented us from evaluating ageclass specific changes in size. Therefore, we used a weight-of-evidence approach based on differences among trophy categories in life-history characteristics, geographic distribution, morphological attributes, and harvest regimes to discriminate among competing hypotheses for explaining long-term trends in horn and antler size of trophy ungulates, and provide directions for future research. These hypotheses were young male age structure caused by intensive harvest of males (H1), genetic change as a result of selective male harvest (H2), a sociological effect (H3), effects of climate (H4), and habitat alteration (H5). Although the number of entries per decade has increased for most trophy categories, trends in size of horn-like structures were negative and significant for 11 of 17 antlered categories and 3 of 8 horned categories. Mean predicted declines during 1950--2008 were 1.87\% and 0.68\% for categories of trophy antlers and horns, respectively. Our results were not consistent with a sociological effect (H3), nutritional limitation imposed by climate (H4), or habitat alteration (H5) as potential explanations for long-term trends in size of trophies. In contrast, our results were consistent with a harvest-based explanation. Two of the 3 species that experienced the most conservative harvest regimes in North America (i.e., bighorn sheep [Ovis canadensis] and bison [Bison bison]) did not exhibit a significant, long-term trend in horn size. In addition, horn size of pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), which are capable of attaining peak horn size by 2--3 years of age, increased significantly over the past century. Both of those results provide support for the intensive-harvest hypothesis, which predicts that harvest of males has gradually shifted age structure towards younger, and thus smaller, males. The absence of a significant trend for mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus), which are difficult to accurately judge size of horns in the field, provided some support for the selective-harvest hypothesis. One other prediction that followed from the selective-harvest hypothesis was not supported; horned game were not more susceptible to reductions in size. A harvest-induced reduction in age structure can increase the number of males that are harvested prior to attaining peak horn or antler size, whereas genetic change imposed by selective harvest may be less likely to occur in free-ranging populations when other factors, such as age and nutrition, can override genetic potential for size. Long-term trends in the size of trophy horn-like structures provide the incentive to evaluate the appropriateness of the current harvest paradigm, wherein harvest is focused largely on males; although the lack of information on age of specimens prevented us from rigorously differentiating among causal mechanisms. Disentangling potential mechanisms underpinning long-term trends in horn and antler size is a daunting task, but one that is worthy of additional research focused on elucidating the relative influence of nutrition and effects (both demographic and genetic) of harvest. {\ss} 2013 The Wildlife Society.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Inbreeding depression is expected to play an important but complicated role in evolution. If we are to understand the evolution of inbreeding depression (i.e., purging), we need quantitative genetic interpretations of its variation. We introduce an experimental design in which sires are mated to multiple dams, some of which are unrelated to the sire but others are genetically related owing to an arbitrary number of prior generations of selfing or sib-mating. In this way we introduce the concept of ``inbreeding depression effect variance,'' a parameter more relevant to selection and the purging of inbreeding depression than previous measures. We develop an approach for interpreting the genetic basis of the variation in inbreeding depression by: (1) predicting the variation in inbreeding depression given arbitrary initial genetic variance and (2) estimating genetic variance components given half-sib covariances estimated by our experimental design. As quantitative predictions of selection depend upon understanding genetic variation, our approach reveals the important difference between how inbreeding depression is measured experimentally and how it is viewed by selection.},

Here, we investigated the genomics of local adaptation in two nonsister woodpeckers that are codistributed across an entire continent and exhibit remarkably convergent patterns of geographic variation. We sequenced the genomes of 140 individuals of Downy (               Dryobates pubescens               ) and Hairy (               Dryobates villosus               ) woodpeckers and used a suite of genomic approaches to identify loci under selection. We showed evidence that convergent genes have been targeted by selection in response to shared environmental pressures, such as temperature and precipitation. Among candidates, we found multiple genes putatively linked to key phenotypic adaptations to climate, including differences in body size (e.g.,               IGFPB               ) and plumage (e.g.,               MREG               ). These results are consistent with genetic constraints limiting the pathways of adaptation to broad climatic gradients, even after genetic backgrounds diverge.                        ,              Shared genes underlie local adaptation in two broadly distributed North American woodpeckers.},

Conventional methods of quantifying stress (cortisol levels, heart rate/heart rate variability) require specialist equipment and are not instantly available. Spontaneous blink rate (SBR) has previously been used to measure stress responses in humans and may provide a non-invasive method for measuring stress in other animal species. Here we investigated the use of SBR as a measure of stress in the domestic horse. SBR was measured before and during a low-stress event (sham clipping) and compared with heart rate variability and salivary cortisol. For the entire sample, there was a reduction in SBR (startle response) during the first minute of clipping. For horses reactive to clipping, the initial reduction in SBR was followed by an increase above baseline whereas the SBR of the non-reactive horses quickly returned to baseline. For the entire sample, SBR correlated with heart rate variability and salivary cortisol. We have demonstrated that SBR is a valid fast alternative measure of stress in horses, but the initial 'startle' response must be considered when using this parameter as a measure of animal stress.},

  abstract = {Competition among domesticated plants or animals can have a dramatic negative impact on yield of a stand or farm. The usual quantitative genetic model ignores these competitive interactions and could result in seriously incorrect breeding decisions and acerbate animal well-being. A general solution to this problem is given, for either forest tree breeding or penned animals, with mixed-model methodology (BLUP) utilized to separate effects on the phenotype due to the individuals' own genes (direct effects) and those from competing individuals (associative effects) and thereby to allow an optimum index selection on those effects. Biological verification was based on two lines of Japanese quail selected for 6-week weight; one line was selected only for direct effects (D-BLUP) while the other was selected on an optimal index for both direct and associative effects (C-BLUP). Results over 23 cycles of selection showed that C-BLUP produced a significant positive response to selection (b = 0.52 {\textpm} 0.25 g/hatch) whereas D-BLUP resulted in a nonsignificant negative response (b = -0.10 {\textpm} 0.25 g/hatch). The regression of percentage of mortality on hatch number was significantly different between methods, decreasing with C-BLUP (b = -0.06 {\textpm} 0.15 deaths/hatch) and increasing with D-BLUP (b = 0.32 {\textpm} 0.15 deaths/hatch). These results demonstrate that the traditional D-BLUP approach without associative effects not only is detrimental to response to selection but also compromises the well-being of animals. The differences in response show that competitive effects can be included in breeding programs, without measuring new traits, so that costs of the breeding program need not increase.},

However, the impact on biological processes of other Southern Ocean currents is less clear. Adjacent to the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), the ACC flows offshore in a northeastward direction, whereas the Antarctic Peninsula Coastal Current (APCC) follows a complex circulation pattern along the coast, with topographically influenced deflections depending on the area. Using genomic data, we estimated genetic structure and migration rates between populations of the benthic bivalve               Aequiyoldia eightsii               from the shallows of southern South America and the WAP to test the role of the ACC and the APCC in its dispersal. We found strong genetic structure across the ACC (between southern South America and Antarctica) and moderate structure between populations of the WAP. Migration rates along the WAP were consistent with the APCC being important for species dispersal. Along with supporting current knowledge about ocean circulation models at the WAP, migration from the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula to the Bellingshausen Sea highlights the complexities of Southern Ocean circulation. This study provides novel biological evidence of a role of the APCC as a driver of species dispersal and highlights the power of genomic data for aiding in the understanding of the influence of complex oceanographic processes in shaping the population structure of marine species.},

Loss of genomewide variation may ultimately reduce the evolutionary potential of animal populations experiencing rapidly changing conditions. In this study, we examined genomewide variation among 23 white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) populations sampled along an urbanization gradient in the New York City metropolitan area. Genomewide variation was estimated as a proxy for evolutionary potential using more than 10 000 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers generated by ddRAD-Seq. We found that genomewide variation is inversely related to urbanization as measured by percent impervious surface cover, and to a lesser extent, human population density. We also report that urbanization results in enhanced genomewide differentiation between populations in cities. There was no pattern of isolation by distance among these populations, but an isolation by resistance model based on impervious surface significantly explained patterns of genetic differentiation. Isolation by environment modeling also indicated that urban populations deviate much more strongly from global allele frequencies than suburban or rural populations. This study is the first to examine loss of genomewide SNP variation along an urban-to-rural gradient and quantify urbanization as a driver of population genomic patterns.},

  abstract = {Repeatable behavioural traits (`personality') have been shown to covary with fitness, but it remains poorly understood how such behaviour--fitness relationships come about. We applied a multivariate approach to reveal the mechanistic pathways by which variation in exploratory and aggressive behaviour is translated into variation in reproductive success in a natural population of blue tits,               Cyanistes caeruleus               . Using path analysis, we demonstrate a key role for provisioning behaviour in mediating the link between personality and reproductive success (number of fledged offspring). Aggressive males fed their nestlings at lower rates than less aggressive individuals. At the same time, their low parental investment was associated with increased female effort, thereby positively affecting fledgling production. Whereas male exploratory behaviour was unrelated to provisioning behaviour and reproductive success, fast-exploring females fed their offspring at higher rates and initiated breeding earlier, thus increasing reproductive success. Our findings provide strong support for specific mechanistic pathways linking components of behavioural syndromes to reproductive success. Importantly, relationships between behavioural phenotypes and reproductive success were obscured when considering simple bivariate relationships, underlining the importance of adopting multivariate views and statistical tools as path analysis to the study of behavioural evolution.},

However, selective harvesting in meat and recreational hunting cultures does not automatically imply directional selection for trait size. Harvesting selectivity is more than a matter of hunter preference. Selection is influenced by management regulations, hunting methods, animal trait variance, behaviour and abundance. Most studies of hunter selection only report age- or sex-specific selection, or differences in trait size selection among hunting methods or groups of hunters, rather than trait size relative to the age-specific means required for directional selection. Synthesis and applications. Managers aiming to avoid rapid evolution should not only consider directional selection and trophy hunting but also mitigate other important evolutionary forces such as harvesting intensity per se, and sexual selection processes that are affected by skewed sex ratios and age structures. {\copyright} 2011 The Author.

We sought, in this study, to characterize the genome-wide DNA methylation signature in systemic sclerosis microvascular endothelial cells.Methods:We performed a genome-wide DNA methylation study in microvascular endothelial cells derived from seven diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis patients compared to seven age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched healthy controls. We paired matched samples on Illumina HumanMethylation450 (three diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis microvascular endothelial cells and three controls), and reproduced the results in an independent set of matched patient and controls using Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC (four diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis patients and four controls) to identify differentially methylated genes.Results:We identified 71,353 differentially methylated CpG sites in systemic sclerosis microvascular endothelial cells using Infinium MethylationEPIC microarray in the first group (0.081\% of representative probes) and 33,170 CpG sites in the second group using HumanMethylation450 microarray (0.073\% of representative probes) in diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis microvascular endothelial cells. Among the two groups of subjects, we identified differential methylation of 2455 CpG sites, representing 1301 genes. Most of the differentially methylated CpG sites were hypermethylated (1625 CpG), corresponding to 910 genes. Common hypermethylated genes in systemic sclerosis microvascular endothelial cells include NOS1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, HDAC4, and ANGPT2. We also identified hypomethylation of IL17RA, CTNNA3, ICAM2, and SDK1 in systemic sclerosis microvascular endothelial cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate significant inverse correlation between DNA methylation status and gene expression in the majority of genes evaluated. Gene ontology analysis of hypermethylated genes demonstrated enrichment of genes involved in angiogenesis (p = 0.0006). Pathway analysis of hypomethylated genes includes genes involved in vascular smooth muscle contraction (p = 0.014) and adherens junctions (p = 0.013).Conclusion:Our data suggest the presence of significant genome-wide DNA methylation aberrancies in systemic sclerosis microvascular endothelial cells, and identify novel affected genes and pathways in systemic sclerosis microvascular endothelial cells.},

Experimental manipulation of brood sizes can result in reduced offspring condition, indicating that developmental deficits in enlarged broods have consequences within the affected generation. Yet, it is unclear whether stress during early development can have fitness consequences projecting into the next generation. To study such trans-generational fitness effects, we bred female zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata , whose mothers had been raised in different experimental brood sizes. We found that adult females were increasingly smaller with increasing experimental brood size in which their mother had been raised. Furthermore, reproductive success at hatching and fledging covaried negatively with the experimental brood size in which their mothers were raised. These results illustrate that early developmental stress can have long-lasting effects affecting reproductive success of future generations.

To study long-term effects (i.e. transgenerational effects of developmental stress), we conducted a two-step breeding experiment in which we manipulated early developmental conditions in zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata . We raised zebra finches by manipulating brood sizes and controlled for maternal and genetic effects by cross-fostering. In a previous study, we showed that offspring condition and body size decreased with increasing brood size. Here we show that this effect was carried over to the next generation. Body size in nestlings and at nutritional independence was affected by the brood size in which the mothers were raised. Female offspring did significantly worse than male offspring when the mother had been raised in large broods, suggesting sex-specific influences of maternal effects. These findings directly link early developmental stress in females via maternal effects to the phenotype of the next generation.},

Recent papers argue that epigenetic marks acquired through experience are passed to offspring, but as in much of the field of epigenetics, there is lack of precision in the definitions and perhaps too much eagerness to translate animal research to humans. Here, we review operational definitions of transgenerational inheritance and the processes of epigenetic programing during early development. Subsequently, based on this background, we critically examine some recent findings of studies investigating transgenerational inheritance. Finally, we discuss possible mechanisms that may explain transgenerational inheritance, including transmission of an epigenetic blueprint, which may predispose offspring to specific epigenetic patterning. Taken together, we conclude that presently, the evidence suggesting that acquired epigenetic marks are passed to the subsequent generation remains limited.},

More recently, these studies have advanced our understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of the immunityfertility dialogue. Here, we review the molecular connections between reproduction and immunity from the perspective of human pregnancy to mechanistic discoveries in laboratory organisms. We focus particularly on recent invertebrate studies identifying conserved signaling pathways and transcription factors that regulate resource allocation and shape the balance between reproductive status and immune health.},

  abstract = {Native ungulate species constitute an important source of protein for Mesoamerican subsistence hunters. In this study, we (1) provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that source--sink systems help maintain some of the ungulate populations in the Lacandon Forest, Mexico; and (2) test the assumptions that density, age structure, and sex ratios are different in slightly hunted (potential sources) and persistently hunted (potential sinks) populations. From May 1998 to March 2001 we observed 1144 individuals and 1153 tracks of five ungulate species (Baird's tapir, collared peccary, white-lipped peccary, red brocket deer, and white-tailed deer) along 1908 km of line transects in slightly and persistently hunted sites of Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve (MABR) and adjacent community lands. Densities of Baird's tapir and white-lipped peccary were lower in persistently hunted sites, where there were higher proportions of young tapirs and white-tailed deer. The sustainability of hunting was evaluated in five communities using information on harvest rates, production rates, and density of each population. Our results suggest that persistently hunted populations of Baird's tapir and white-lipped peccary are at risk of local extinction, while collared peccary hunting appears to be sustainable. The red brocket deer, although locally overhunted, maintains a relatively safe status probably through a source--sink system in which MABR functions as the source of individuals which are readily hunted in adjacent community lands. Source--sink systems may be also important in maintaining Baird's tapir and white-lipped peccary populations outside protected areas of the Lacandon Forest, from evidence of migration observed during this study.},

  abstract = {Summary: Runs of homozygosity (RoHs) are genomic stretches of a diploid genome that show identical alleles on both chromosomes. Longer RoHs are unlikely to have arisen by chance but are likely to denote autozygosity, whereby both copies of the genome descend from the same recent ancestor. Early tools to detect RoH used genotype array data, but substantially more information is available from sequencing data. Here, we present and evaluate BCFtools/RoH, an extension to the BCFtools software package, that detects regions of autozygosity in sequencing data, in particular exome data, using a hidden Markov model. By applying it to simulated data and real data from the 1000 Genomes Project we estimate its accuracy and show that it has higher sensitivity and specificity than existing methods under a range of sequencing error rates and levels of autozygosity.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic mortality of wildlife is typically inferred from measures of the absolute decline in population numbers. However, increasing evidence suggests that indirect demographic effects including changes to the age, sex, and social structure of populations, as well as the behavior of survivors, can profoundly impact population health and viability. Specifically, anthropogenic mortality of wildlife (especially when unsustainable) and fragmentation of the spatial distribution of individuals (homeranges) could disrupt natal dispersal mechanisms, with long-term consequences to genetic structure, by compromising outbreeding behavior and gene flow. We investigate this threat in African leopards (Panthera pardus pardus), a polygynous felid with male-biased natal dispersal. Using a combination of spatial (home-range) and genetic (21 polymorphic microsatellites) data from 142 adult leopards, we contrast the structure of two South African populations with markedly different histories of anthropogenically linked mortality. Home-range overlap, parentage assignment, and spatio-genetic autocorrelation together show that historical exploitation of leopards in a recovering protected area has disrupted and reduced subadult male dispersal, thereby facilitating opportunistic male natal philopatry, with sons establishing territories closer to their mothers and sisters. The resultant kin-clustering in males of this historically exploited population is comparable to that of females in a well-protected reserve and has ultimately led to localized inbreeding. Our findings demonstrate novel evidence directly linking unsustainable anthropogenic mortality to inbreeding through disrupted dispersal in a large, solitary felid and expose the genetic consequences underlying this behavioral change. We therefore emphasize the importance of managing and mitigating the effects of unsustainable exploitation on local populations and increasing habitat fragmentation between contiguous protected areas by promoting in situ recovery and providing corridors of suitable habitat that maintain genetic connectivity.},

These sensors measure the activity, housing conditions, feed intake, and health of farm animals. With traditional methods, the data from farm animals and their environment can be collected intermittently. However, with the advancement of wearable and non-invasive sensing tools, these measurements can be made in real-time for continuous quantitation relating to clinical biomarkers, resilience indicators, and behavioral predictors. The digital phenotyping of humans has drawn enormous attention recently due to its medical significance, but much research is still needed for the digital phenotyping of farm animals. Implications from human studies show great promise for the application of digital phenotyping technology in modern livestock farming, but these technologies must be directly applied to animals to understand their true capacities. Due to species-specific traits, certain technologies required to assess phenotypes need to be tailored efficiently and accurately. Such devices allow for the collection of information that can better inform farmers on aspects of animal welfare and production that need improvement. By explicitly addressing farm animals' individual physiological and mental (affective states) needs, sensor-based digital phenotyping has the potential to serve as an effective intervention platform. Future research is warranted for the design and development of digital phenotyping technology platforms that create shared data standards, metrics, and repositories.},

AI and ML in particular are widely used in animal husbandry to monitor both the animals and environment around the clock, which leads to a better understanding of animal behavior and distress, disease control and prevention, and effective business decisions for the farmer. One particularly promising area that advances upon AI is digital twin technology, which is currently used to improve efficiencies and reduce costs across multiple industries and sectors. In contrast to a model, a digital twin is a digital replica of a real-world entity that is kept current with a constant influx of data. The application of digital twins within the livestock farming sector is the next frontier and has the potential to be used to improve large-scale precision livestock farming practices, machinery and equipment usage, and the health and well-being of a wide variety of farm animals. The mental and emotional states of animals can be monitored using recognition technology that examines facial features, such as ear postures and eye white regions. Used with modeling, simulation and augmented reality technologies, digital twins can help farmers to build more energy-efficient housing structures, predict heat cycles for breeding, discourage negative behaviors of livestock, and potentially much more. As with all disruptive technological advances, the implementation of digital twin technology will demand a thorough cost and benefit analysis of individual farms. Our goal in this review is to assess the progress toward the use of digital twin technology in livestock farming, with the goal of revolutionizing animal husbandry in the future.},

Currently there are no `benchmarks' or any scientific assessments available for measuring and quantifying the emotional responses of farm animals. Using sensors to collect biometric data as a means of measuring animal emotions is a topic of growing interest in agricultural technology. Here we reviewed several aspects of the use of sensor-based approaches in monitoring animal emotions, beginning with an introduction on animal emotions. Then we reviewed some of the available tech-nological systems for analyzing animal emotions. These systems include a variety of sensors, the algorithms used to process biometric data taken from these sensors, facial expression, and sound analysis. We conclude that a single emotional expression measurement based on either the facial feature of animals or the physiological functions cannot show accurately the farm animal's emotional changes, and hence compound expression recognition measurement is required. We propose some novel ways to combine sensor technologies through sensor fusion into efficient systems for monitoring and measuring the animals' compound expression of emotions. Finally, we explore future perspectives in the field, including challenges and opportunities.},

  abstract = {Alternative reproductive tactics often take the form of dichotomous behavioural phenotypes. Focusing attention on such obvious dichotomy means that flexible patterns of behaviour within tactics is largely ignored. Using a long-term dataset of black grouse (Lyrurus tetrix) lek behaviours, we tested whether there were fine-scale differences in reproductive effort (lek attendance, fighting rates) and whether these were related to age and phenotype. Yearling males increased their lek attendance and fighting rate to a peak when adult male effort was declining. Adults and yearlings allocated reproductive effort according to their body mass but this was unrelated to differences in timing of effort. In adult males, different patterns of lek attendance were associated with different costs of reproduction, measured by mass loss or gain. Overall, our work demonstrates that individuals can use flexible patterns of reproductive effort both in terms of their own condition, their age and the likely costs of behaviours.},

However, a small, resident population in the Gulf of California was not targeted by whaling. Here, we analyzed 50 whole-genomes from the Eastern North Pacific (ENP) and Gulf of California (GOC) fin whale populations to investigate their demographic history and the genomic effects of natural and human-induced bottlenecks. We show that the two populations diverged {\textasciitilde}16,000 years ago, after which the ENP population expanded and then suffered a 99\% reduction in effective size during the whaling period. In contrast, the GOC population remained small and isolated, receiving less than one migrant per generation. However, this low level of migration has been crucial for maintaining its viability. Our study exposes the severity of whaling, emphasizes the importance of migration, and demonstrates the use of genome-based analyses and simulations to inform conservation strategies.},

  abstract = {International conferences are an important component of the professional calendar of scientists and practitioners in many fields, and are valued as opportunities to establish, create and foster networks, wellbeing and knowledge. The 2020 global pandemic, in prohibiting large gatherings and travel, has provided an opportunity to test the feasibility and implications of a shift from in-person to online conference formats. Avoiding international travel and associated bureaucracy, time and expense could overcome many of the historic injustices preventing many from participating in and benefiting from international conferences, and also avoid the emissions associated with international air travel. However, prior to 2020, there has been resistance to moving these events online because of the perception that the value of conferences cannot be cultivated online. Here, we use the example of the 6th International Marine Conservation Congress (IMCC6), which moved online in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, to explore participants' perceptions and experiences of an online conference and the potential effects on access and inclusion. Our results show that moving online substantially increased the accessibility of the conference for those who would be unable to attend an in-person event for financial or personal reasons. Results also indicate that the online experience was able to recreate some of the benefits of in-person events, and that many participants are interested in attending online or virtual events in the future. However, the degree of enjoyment experienced or perceived `value' likely relates to the frame of reference of the individual participant and a commitment to actively engage in the program. Reflecting on the success of IMCC6, we conclude that holding international conferences online, or at least including an online element as part of a `hybrid' model, is a significant improvement in the capacity of conferences to meet the moral imperatives of the conservation community by addressing the climate crisis and some of the systemic injustices within the field.},

In those experiments, artificially exerted environmental stress induced plastic phenotypic changes in the fruit flies, but after some generations, the same phenotypic variant started to appear without the environmental stress. Both the initial state (where the phenotypic changes were environmentally induced and plastic) and the final state (where the phenotypic changes were genetically fixed and constitutive) are experimental facts. However, it remains unclear how the environmentally induced phenotypic change in the first generation becomes genetically fixed in the central process of genetic assimilation itself. We have argued that the key to understanding the mechanism of genetic assimilation lies in epigenetics, and proposed the ``cooperative model'' in which the evolutionary process depends on both genetic and epigenetic factors. Evolutionary simulations based on the cooperative model reproduced the process of genetic assimilation. Detailed analysis of the trajectories has revealed genetic assimilation is a process in which epigenetically induced phenotypic changes are incrementally and statistically replaced with multiple minor genetic mutations through natural selection. In this scenario, epigenetic and genetic changes may be considered as mutually independent but equivalent in terms of their effects on phenotypic changes. This finding rejects the common (and confused) hypothesis that epigenetically induced phenotypic changes depend on genetic mutations. Furthermore, we argue that transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is not required for evolution by genetic assimilation.},

Yet, studies using modern genomic tools to investigate inbreeding depression in nature have been limited to single populations, and little is known about the dynamics of inbreeding depression in subdivided populations over time. Natural populations often experience different environmental conditions and differ in demographic history and genetic composition, characteristics that can affect the severity of inbreeding depression. We utilized extensive long-term data on more than 3,100 individuals from eight islands in an insular house sparrow metapopulation to examine the generality of inbreeding effects. Using genomic estimates of realized inbreeding, we discovered that inbred individuals had lower survival probabilities and produced fewer recruiting offspring than noninbred individuals. Inbreeding depression, measured as the decline in fitness-related traits per unit inbreeding, did not vary appreciably among populations or with time. As a consequence, populations with more resident inbreeding (due to their demographic history) paid a higher total fitness cost, evidenced by a larger variance in fitness explained by inbreeding within these populations. Our results are in contrast to the idea that effects of inbreeding generally depend on ecological factors and genetic differences among populations, and expand the understanding of inbreeding depression in natural subdivided populations.},

  abstract = {Economic pressures continue to mount on modern-day livestock farmers, forcing them to increase herds sizes in order to be commercially viable. The natural consequence of this is to drive the farmer and the animal further apart. However, closer attention to the animal not only positively impacts animal welfare and health but can also increase the capacity of the farmer to achieve a more sustainable production. State-of-the-art precision livestock farming (PLF) technology is one such means of bringing the animals closer to the farmer in the facing of expanding systems. Contrary to some current opinions, it can offer an alternative philosophy to 'farming by numbers'. This review addresses the key technology-oriented approaches to monitor animals and demonstrates how image and sound analyses can be used to build 'digital representations' of animals by giving an overview of some of the core concepts of PLF tool development and value discovery during PLF implementation. The key to developing such a representation is by measuring important behaviours and events in the livestock buildings. The application of image and sound can realise more advanced applications and has enormous potential in the industry. In the end, the importance lies in the accuracy of the developed PLF applications in the commercial farming system as this will also make the farmer embrace the technological development and ensure progress within the PLF field in favour of the livestock animals and their well-being.},

This distinction between postdiction and prediction is appreciated conceptually but is not respected in practice. Mistaking generation of postdictions with testing of predictions reduces the credibility of research findings. However, ordinary biases in human reasoning, such as hindsight bias, make it hard to avoid this mistake. An effective solution is to define the research questions and analysis plan before observing the research outcomes---a process called preregistration. Preregistration distinguishes analyses and outcomes that result from predictions from those that result from postdictions. A variety of practical strategies are available to make the best possible use of preregistration in circumstances that fall short of the ideal application, such as when the data are preexisting. Services are now available for preregistration across all disciplines, facilitating a rapid increase in the practice. Widespread adoption of preregistration will increase distinctiveness between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing and will improve the credibility of research findings.},

A literature review of studies of subsistence hunting in the Neotropics suggests that hunting is often conducted in areas adjacent to relatively undisturbed habitat that may act as sources of animals for the hunted sites. We compared studies of tapir ( Tapirus terrestris) hunting at different sites to illustrate the potential bias of sustainability evaluations based on local productivity. The limited information available suggests that dispersal could have a key role in rebuilding animal populations depleted by hunting. Thus, factors that strongly affect dispersal---such as spatial distribution and size of areas with and without hunting, population size in source areas, and social behavior---should be considered when the sustainability of hunting is evaluated in areas with heterogeneous hunting pressure. We suggest the application of two models that use spatial controls (recognizing the potential source-sink nature of some hunted systems and protecting unhunted refugia) to avoid wildlife overexploitation when biological data and enforcement capabilities to regulate harvests are limited. This approach may produce more reliable evaluations of sustainability, provide information on the dynamics of hunting systems, and help local communities and policymakers conserve key areas (including protected areas) that may act as game sources.},

Nevertheless, SNP data is desirable both for genotyping and to understand the DNA methylome in the context of the genetic background. The confounding effect of bisulfite conversion can be resolved by observing differences in allele counts on a per-strand basis, whereby artificial mutations are reflected by non-complementary base pairs. Herein, we present a computational pre-processing approach for adapting sequence alignment data, thus indirectly enabling downstream analysis in this manner using conventional variant calling software such as GATK or Freebayes. In comparison to specialised tools, the method represents a marked improvement in precision-sensitivity based on high-quality, published benchmark datasets for both human and model plant variants.},

  abstract = {A growing literature now documents the presence of fine-scale genetic structure in wild vertebrate populations. Breeding population size, levels of dispersal and polygyny --- all hypothesized to affect population genetic structure --- are known to be influenced by ecological conditions experienced by populations. However the possibility of temporal or spatial variation in fine-scale genetic structure as a result of ecological change is rarely considered or explored. Here we investigate temporal variation in fine-scale genetic structure in a red deer population on the Isle or Rum, Scotland. We document extremely fine-scale spatial genetic structure ({$<$} 100 m) amongst females but not males across a 24-year study period during which resource competition has intensified and the population has reached habitat carrying capacity. Based on census data, adult deer were allocated to one of three subpopulations in each year of the study. Global FST estimates for females generated using these subpopulations decreased over the study period, indicating a rapid decline in fine-scale genetic structure of the population. Global FST estimates for males were not different from zero across the study period. Using census and genetic data, we illustrate that, as a consequence of a release from culling early in the study period, the number of breeding females has increased while levels of polygyny have decreased in this population. We found little evidence for increasing dispersal between subpopulations over time in either sex. We argue that both increasing female population size and decreasing polygyny could explain the decline in female population genetic structure.},

We conducted a survey of African American (N\,=\,360), Latino/a/Hispanic (N\,=\,313), White (N\,=\,709), and Asian/Asian American (N\,=\,524) college undergraduates majoring in science, technology, engineering, and math fields and used the results to test several interrelated hypotheses derived from our theoretical model. Compared to Whites, ethnic minorities were more likely to experience challenges to inclusion in EEB (e.g., less exposure to ecology, fewer same-race role models, discomfort in outdoor environments). Challenges to inclusion were associated with a decreased sense of belonging in EEB educational contexts. Finally, experiencing a low sense of belonging in EEB educational contexts was associated with lower interest in pursuing graduate education in EEB. Sense of belonging in EEB was especially low among African Americans relative to Whites. We discuss the implications of the study results for educational interventions.},

  abstract = {Rapid environmental change is predicted to compromise population survival, and the resulting strong selective pressure can erode genetic variation, making evolutionary rescue unlikely. Non-genetic inheritance may provide a solution to this problem and help explain the current lack of fit between purely genetic evolutionary models and empirical data. We hypothesize that epigenetic modifications can facilitate evolutionary rescue through `epigenetic buffering'. By facilitating the inheritance of novel phenotypic variants that are generated by environmental change---a strategy we call `heritable bet hedging'---epigenetic modifications could maintain and increase the evolutionary potential of a population. This process may facilitate genetic adaptation by preserving existing genetic variation, releasing cryptic genetic variation and/or facilitating mutations in functional loci. Although we show that examples of non-genetic inheritance are often maladaptive in the short term, accounting for phenotypic variance and non-adaptive plasticity may reveal important evolutionary implications over longer time scales. We also discuss the possibility that maladaptive epigenetic responses may be due to `epigenetic traps', whereby evolutionarily novel factors (e.g. endocrine disruptors) hack into the existing epigenetic machinery. We stress that more ecologically relevant work on transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is required. Researchers conducting studies on transgenerational environmental effects should report measures of phenotypic variance, so that the possibility of both bet hedging and heritable bet hedging can be assessed. Future empirical and theoretical work is required to assess the relative importance of genetic and epigenetic variation, and their interaction, for evolutionary rescue.},

  abstract = {Development of next generation sequencing technologies has enabled detection of extensive arrays of germline and somatic single nucleotide variations (               SNVs               ) in human diseases.               SNVs               affecting intronic               GT-AG               dinucleotides invariably compromise pre-               mRNA               splicing. Most exonic               SNVs               introduce missense/nonsense codons, but some affect auxiliary splicing               cis               -elements or generate cryptic               GT-AG               dinucleotides. Similarly, most intronic               SNVs               are silent, but some affect canonical and auxiliary splicing               cis               -elements or generate cryptic               GT-AG               dinucleotides. However, prediction of the splicing effects of               SNVs               is challenging. The splicing effects of               SNVs               generating cryptic               AG               or disrupting canonical               AG               can be inferred from the               AG               -scanning model. Similarly, the splicing effects of               SNVs               affecting the first nucleotide G of an exon can be inferred from               AG               -dependence of the 3{$\prime$} splice site (ss). A variety of tools have been developed for predicting the splicing effects of               SNVs               affecting the 5{$\prime$} ss, as well as exonic and intronic splicing enhancers/silencers. In contrast, only two tools, the Human Splicing Finder and the               SVM-BP               finder, are available for predicting the position of the branch point sequence. Similarly,               IntSplice               and               Splicing based Analysis of Variants (SPANR)               are the only tools to predict the splicing effects of intronic               SNVs               . The rules and tools introduced in this review are mostly based on observations of a limited number of genes, and no rule or tool can ensure 100\% accuracy. Experimental validation is always required before any clinically relevant conclusions are drawn.

  abstract = {Structural equation modeling (SEM) holds the promise of providing natural scientists the capacity to evaluate complex multivariate hypotheses about ecological systems. Building on its predecessors, path analysis and factor analysis, SEM allows for the incorporation of both observed and unobserved (latent) variables into theoretically based probabilistic models. In this paper we discuss the interface between theory and data in SEM and the use of an additional variable type, the composite, for representing general concepts. In simple terms, composite variables specify the influences of collections of other variables and can be helpful in modeling general relationships of the sort commonly of interest to ecologists. While long recognized as a potentially important element of SEM, composite variables have received very limited use, in part because of a lack of theoretical consideration, but also because of difficulties that arise in parameter estimation when using conventional solution procedures. In this paper we present a framework for discussing composites and demonstrate how the use of partially reduced form models can help to overcome some of the parameter estimation and evaluation problems associated with models containing composites. Diagnostic procedures for evaluating the most appropriate and effective use of composites are illustrated with an example from the ecological literature. It is argued that an ability to incorporate composite variables into structural equation models may be particularly valuable in the study of natural systems, where concepts are frequently multifaceted and the influences of suites of variables are often of interest.},

Experiments that seek to demonstrate a cause/effect relation most often manipulate the postulated causal factor.

Assessing whether the replication and the original experiment yielded the same result according to several criteria, they find that about one-third to one-half of the original findings were also observed in the replication study.

Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error.                                         RATIONALE               There is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science.                                         RESULTS                                We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and                 P                 values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (                 M                 r                 = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (                 M                 r                 = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (                 P                 {$<$} .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.                                                        CONCLUSION                                No single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original                 P                 value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here.                              Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that ``we already know this'' belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know.                                                   Original study effect size versus replication effect size (correlation coefficients).                   Diagonal line represents replication effect size equal to original effect size. Dotted line represents replication effect size of 0. Points below the dotted line were effects in the opposite direction of the original. Density plots are separated by significant (blue) and nonsignificant (red) effects.                                                                         ,              Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available.

  abstract = {The evolution of territoriality reflects the balance between the benefit and cost of monopolising a resource. While the benefit of territoriality is generally intuitive (improved access to resources), our understanding of its cost is less clear. This paper combines: 1. a review of hypotheses and meta-analytic benchmarking of costs across diverse taxa; and 2. a new empirical test of hypotheses using a longitudinal study of free-living male territorial lizards. The cost of territoriality was best described as a culmination of multiple factors, but especially costs resulting from the time required to maintain a territory (identified by the meta-analysis) or those exacerbated by a territory that is large in size (identified by the empirical test). The meta-analysis showed that physiological costs such as energetic expenditure or stress were largely negligible in impact on territory holders. Species that used territories to monopolise access to mates appeared to incur the greatest costs, whereas those defending food resources experienced the least. The single largest gap in our current understanding revealed by the literature review is the potential cost associated with increased predation. There is also a clear need for multiple costs to be evaluated concurrently in a single species. The empirical component of this study showcases a powerful analytical framework for evaluating a range of hypotheses using correlational data obtained in the field. More broadly, this paper highlights key factors that should be considered in any investigation that attempts to account for the evolutionary origin or ecological variation in territorial behaviour within and between species.},

  abstract = {One of the first patterns noticed by geneticists was that mutations are almost always recessive to their wild-type alleles. Several explanations of this striking pattern have been offered. The two most influential are Fisher's theory--which argues that dominance results from natural selection against recurring deleterious mutations--and Wright's theory--which argues that dominance results from the physiology of gene action. The debate over which of these theories is correct represents one of the most protracted controversies in the history of evolutionary biology. Here I test Fisher's theory by assessing the dominance of mutations in an organism that is typically haploid, the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The results show that mutations are recessive just as often among haploid as among diploid species. This result falsifies Fisher's theory of dominance and provides strong support for the alternative physiological theory.},

  abstract = {Plant species differ in their ecological amplitude, with some species occurring in very different habitats under strongly differentiated environmental conditions. We were interested in to what extent the occurrence of Linum catharticum in dry calcareous grasslands (Bromion) and wet litter meadows (Molinion), two habitats on opposing ends concerning, for example, moisture level, is reflected on the genetic and epigenetic level. Using AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphisms) and MSAP (methylation sensitive amplification polymorphisms) analyses, we studied the genetic and epigenetic variation of L. catharticum from calcareous grasslands and litter meadows. From each habitat, we included five study sites with 16 individuals per sampling location. We observed lower genetic than epigenetic diversity, but considerable differen tiation among habitats, which was stronger on the genetic than the epigenetic level. Additionally, we observed a strong correlation of genetic and epigenetic distance, irrespective of geographic distance. The dataset included a large portion of fragments exclusively found in individuals from one or the other habitat. Some epigenetic fragments even occurred in different methylation states depending on the habitat. We conclude that environmental effects act on both the genetic and epigenetic level, producing the clear differentiation among plant individuals from calcareous grasslands and litter meadows. These results may also point into the direction of ecotype formation in this species.},

Behavioral epigenetics is defined as the study of how epigenetic alterations induced by experience and environmental stress may affect animal behavior. It studies epigenetic alterations due to environmental enrichment. Generally, molecular processes underlying epigenetic regulation in behavioral epigenetics include DNA methylation, post-translational histone modifications, noncoding RNA activity, and other unknown molecular processes. Whether the inheritance of epigenetic features will occur is a crucial question. In general, the mechanism underlying inheritance can be explained by two main phenomena: Germline-mediated epigenetic inheritance and interact epigenetic inheritance of somatic cells through germline. In this review, we focus on examining behavioral epigenetics based on its possible modes of inheritance and discuss the considerations in the research of epigenetic transgenerational inheritance.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Reduced representation sequencing (RRS) is a widely used method to assay the diversity of genetic loci across the genome of an organism. The dominant class of RRS approaches assay loci associated with restriction sites within the genome (restriction site associated DNA sequencing, or RADseq). RADseq is frequently applied to non-model organisms since it enables population genetic studies without relying on well-characterized reference genomes. However, RADseq requires the use of many bioinformatic filters to ensure the quality of genotyping calls. These filters can have direct impacts on population genetic inference, and therefore require careful consideration. One widely used filtering approach is the removal of loci that do not conform to expectations of Hardy--Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). Despite being widely used, we show that this filtering approach is rarely described in sufficient detail to enable replication. Furthermore, through analyses of in silico and empirical data sets we show that some of the most widely used HWE filtering approaches dramatically impact inference of population structure. In particular, the removal of loci exhibiting departures from HWE after pooling across samples significantly reduces the degree of inferred population structure within a data set (despite this approach being widely used). Based on these results, we provide recommendations for best practice regarding the implementation of HWE filtering for RADseq data sets.},

Such changes may be population-specific or, alternatively, may involve parallel evolution of the same genomic region in multiple populations, if that region contains genes or co-adapted gene complexes affecting the selected trait(s). Both quantitative and population genetic approaches have identified associations between specific genomic regions and the anadromous (steelhead) and resident (rainbow trout) life-history strategies of               Oncorhynchus mykiss               . Here, we use genotype data from 95 single nucleotide polymorphisms and show that the distribution of variation in a large region of one chromosome, Omy5, is strongly associated with life-history differentiation in multiple above-barrier populations of rainbow trout and their anadromous steelhead ancestors. The associated loci are in strong linkage disequilibrium, suggesting the presence of a chromosomal inversion or other rearrangement limiting recombination. These results provide the first evidence of a common genomic basis for life-history variation in               O. mykiss               in a geographically diverse set of populations and extend our knowledge of the heritable basis of rapid adaptation of complex traits in novel habitats.},

  abstract = {Body condition is assumed to influence an animal's health and fitness. Various non-destructive methods based on body mass and a measure of body length have been used as condition indices (CIs), but the dominant method amongst ecologists is currently the calculation of residuals from an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression of body mass against length. Recent studies of energy reserves in small mammals and starlings claimed to validate this method, although we argue that they did not include the most appropriate tests since they compared the CI with the absolute size of energy reserves. We present a novel CI (the `scaled mass index') based on the central principle of scaling, with important methodological, biological and conceptual advantages. Through a reanalysis of data from small mammals, starlings and snakes, we show that the scaled mass index is a better indicator of the relative size of energy reserves and other body components than OLS residuals, performing better in all seven species and in 19 out of 20 analyses. We also present an empirical and theoretical comparison of the scaled mass index and OLS residuals as CIs. We argue that the scaled mass index is a useful new tool for ecologists.},

There is currently no consensus about the most appropriate condition index (CI) method, and various traditions have been established within subdisciplines in which ecologists tend to apply that method used previously by their peers.                                         2.               {\enspace}Here, we present a reappraisal of six conventional CI methods: Fulton's index (               K{$\quad$}               ={$\quad$}               M               /               L               3               ), Qu{\'e}telet's index (BMI{$\quad$}={$\quad$}               M               /               L               2               ), Relative condition (               K               n               , computed as the observed individual mass divided by the predicted mass               M               i               *{$\quad$}={$\quad$}               a L               i                                b                              where               a               and               b               are determined by ordinary least squares (OLS) regression of               M               against               L               ), Relative mass (               W               r               , where               a               and               b               above are determined from a reference population), the Residual index (               R               i               , the residuals from an OLS regression of               M               against               L               ) and               ancova               . We compare the performance of these methods with that of the Scaled mass index, a novel method which was previously shown to perform better than               R               i               as a predictor of fat and other body components [J. Peig \& A.J.

Using data from three species of small mammals we show that, unlike the Scaled mass index, all six conventional methods fail to do this, and as a result they consistently lead to significant differences in CIs between age classes and sex that are a mere consequence of changes in body size. The Scaled mass index was also particularly successful at detecting changes in CI resulting from high levels of contaminants.},

We investigated evidence for inbreeding depression by environment interactions in nine traits in the individually monitored Soay sheep population of St Kilda, using genomic inbreeding coefficients based on 37\,037 single-nucleotide polymorphism loci, and population density as an axis of environmental variation. All traits showed variation with population density and all traits showed some evidence for depression because of either an individual's own inbreeding or maternal inbreeding. However, only six traits showed evidence for an interaction in the expected direction, and only two interactions were statistically significant. We identify three possible reasons why wild population studies may generally fail to find strong support for interactions between inbreeding depression and environmental variation compared with experimental studies. First, for species with biparental inbreeding only, the amount of observed inbreeding in natural populations is generally low compared with that used in experimental studies. Second, it is possible that experimental studies sometimes actually impose higher levels of stress than organisms experience in the wild. Third, some purging of the deleterious recessive alleles that underpin interaction effects may occur in the wild.},

Inbreeding depression is due to the expression of recessive deleterious alleles that are concealed in heterozygous state in noninbred individuals, the so-called inbreeding load. Genetic purging reduces inbreeding depression by removing these alleles when expressed in homozygosis due to inbreeding. It is generally thought that fast inbreeding (such as that generated by full-sib mating lines) removes only highly deleterious recessive alleles, while slow inbreeding can also remove mildly deleterious ones. However, a question remains regarding which proportion of the inbreeding load can be removed by purging under slow inbreeding in moderately large populations. We report results of two long-term slow inbreeding               Drosophila               experiments (125--234 generations), each using a large population and a number of derived lines with effective sizes about 1000 and 50, respectively. The inbreeding load was virtually exhausted after more than one hundred generations in large populations and between a few tens and over one hundred generations in the lines. This result is not expected from genetic drift alone, and is in agreement with the theoretical purging predictions. Computer simulations suggest that these results are consistent with a model of relatively few deleterious mutations of large homozygous effects and partially recessive gene action.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Genetic rescue is increasingly considered a promising and underused conservation strategy to reduce inbreeding depression and restore genetic diversity in endangered populations, but the empirical evidence supporting its application is limited to a few generations. Here we discuss on the light of theory the role of inbreeding depression arising from partially recessive deleterious mutations and of genetic purging as main determinants of the medium to long-term success of rescue programs. This role depends on two main predictions: (1) The inbreeding load hidden in populations with a long stable demography increases with the effective population size; and (2) After a population shrinks, purging tends to remove its (partially) recessive deleterious alleles, a process that is slower but more efficient for large populations than for small ones. We also carry out computer simulations to investigate the impact of genetic purging on the medium to long term success of genetic rescue programs. For some scenarios, it is found that hybrid vigor followed by purging will lead to sustained successful rescue. However, there may be specific situations where the recipient population is so small that it cannot purge the inbreeding load introduced by migrants, which would lead to increased fitness inbreeding depression and extinction risk in the medium to long term. In such cases, the risk is expected to be higher if migrants came from a large non-purged population with high inbreeding load, particularly after the accumulation of the stochastic effects ascribed to repeated occasional migration events. Therefore, under the specific deleterious recessive mutation model considered, we conclude that additional caution should be taken in rescue programs. Unless the endangered population harbors some distinctive genetic singularity whose conservation is a main concern, restoration by continuous stable gene flow should be considered, whenever feasible, as it reduces the extinction risk compared to repeated occasional migration and can also allow recolonization events.},

Not surprisingly, the poverty stricken regions are also the ones which have a high probability of being a war zone, have poor infrastructure and sometimes have governments that do not cooperate with internationally funded development efforts. We train a CNN on free and publicly available daytime satellite images of the African continent from Landsat 7 to build a model for predicting local economic livelihoods. Only 5\% of the satellite images can be associated with labels (which are obtained from DHS Surveys) and thus a semi-supervised approach using a GAN (similar to the approach of Salimans, et al. (2016)), albeit with a more stable-to-train flavor of GANs called the Wasserstein GAN regularized with gradient penalty(Gulrajani, et al. (2017)) is used. The method of multitask learning is employed to regularize the network and also create an end-to-end model for the prediction of multiple poverty metrics.},

  abstract = {Background: The cattle introduced by European conquerors during the Brazilian colonization period were exposed to a process of natural selection in different types of biomes throughout the country, leading to the development of locally adapted cattle breeds. In this study, whole-genome re-sequencing data from indicine and Brazilian locally adapted taurine cattle breeds were used to detect genomic regions under selective pressure. Within-population and cross-population statistics were combined separately in a single score using the de-correlated composite of multiple signals (DCMS) method. Putative sweep regions were revealed by assessing the top 1\% of the empirical distribution generated by the DCMS statistics. Results: A total of 33,328,447 biallelic SNPs with an average read depth of 12.4X passed the hard filtering process and were used to access putative sweep regions. Admixture has occurred in some locally adapted taurine populations due to the introgression of exotic breeds. The genomic inbreeding coefficient based on runs of homozygosity (ROH) concurred with the populations' historical background. Signatures of selection retrieved from the DCMS statistics provided a comprehensive set of putative candidate genes and revealed QTLs disclosing cattle production traits and adaptation to the challenging environments. Additionally, several candidate regions overlapped with previous regions under selection described in the literature for other cattle breeds. Conclusion: The current study reported putative sweep regions that can provide important insights to better understand the selective forces shaping the genome of the indicine and Brazilian locally adapted taurine cattle breeds. Such regions likely harbor traces of natural selection pressures by which these populations have been exposed and may elucidate footprints for adaptation to the challenging climatic conditions.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The field of urban ecology has provided many fascinating examples of organisms that display novel biological features in urban environments compared to natural habitats. Quantitative genetics provides a framework that can be used to investigate whether this phenotypic differentiation between urban and natural habitats is adaptive and is the result of heritable changes in response to divergent selection. New generation sequencing tools offer unique opportunities to expand our understanding of the genes and genetic mechanisms implicated in evolution in urban environments. This chapter first reviews quantitative genetics studies investigating the mechanisms of evolution in the city. It then reviews pioneering genomic studies that have shed light on the genes and genetic mechanisms implicated in urban microevolution. The authors discuss how further use of cost-effective high-resolution genomic approaches may improve the comprehension of both genomic and epigenomic mechanisms implicated in such evolution. Finally, the chapter provides an overview of how the integrated use of quantitative genetics, field experiments, and genomics could expand our knowledge of the processes leading to urban evolution.},

  abstract = {Urbanization is a growing concern challenging the evolutionary potential of wild populations by reducing genetic diversity and imposing new selection regimes affecting many key fitness traits. However, genomic footprints of urbanization have received little attention so far. Using RAD sequencing, we investigated the genomewide effects of urbanization on neutral and adaptive genomic diversity in 140 adult great tits Parus major collected in locations with contrasted urbanization levels (from a natural forest to highly urbanized areas of a city; Montpellier, France). Heterozygosity was slightly lower in the more urbanized sites compared to the more rural ones. Low but significant effect of urbanization on genetic differentiation was found, at the site level but not at the nest level, indicative of the geographic scale of urbanization impact and of the potential for local adaptation despite gene flow. Gene--environment association tests identified numerous SNPs with small association scores to urbanization, distributed across the genome, from which a subset of 97 SNPs explained up to 81\% of the variance in urbanization, overall suggesting a polygenic response to selection in the urban environment. These findings open stimulating perspectives for broader applications of high-resolution genomic tools on other cities and larger sample sizes to investigate the consistency of the effects of urbanization on the spatial distribution of genetic diversity and the polygenic nature of gene--urbanization association.},

  abstract = {Genomic developments have empowered the investigation of heritability in wild populations directly from genomewide relatedness matrices (GRM). Such GRMbased approaches can in particular be used to improve or substitute approaches based on social pedigree (PED-social). However, measuring heritability from GRM in the wild has not been widely applied yet, especially using small samples and in nonmodel species. Here, we estimated heritability for four quantitative traits (tarsus length, wing length, bill length and body mass), using PED-social, a pedigree corrected by genetic data (PED-corrected) and a GRM from a small sample (n = 494) of blue tits from natural populations in Corsica genotyped at nearly 50,000 filtered SNPs derived from RAD-seq. We also measured genetic correlations among traits, and we performed chromosome partitioning. Heritability estimates were slightly higher when using GRM compared to PED-social, and PED-corrected yielded intermediate values, suggesting a minor underestimation of heritability in PED-social due to incorrect pedigree links, including extra-pair paternity, and to lower information content than the GRM. Genetic correlations among traits were similar between PED-social and GRM but credible intervals were very large in both cases, suggesting a lack of power for this small data set. Although a positive linear relationship was found between the number of genes per chromosome and the chromosome heritability for tarsus length, chromosome partitioning similarly showed a lack of power for the three other traits. We discuss the usefulness and limitations of the quantitative genetic inferences based on genomic data in small samples from wild populations.},

Although the high mutability of CpGs is thought to be relevant for vertebrate evolution, very little is known on the role of CpG-related mutations in the genomic diversification of vertebrates. Our study analysed genetic differences in chickens, between Red Junglefowl (RJF; the living closest relative to the ancestor of domesticated chickens) and domesticated breeds, to identify genomic dynamics that have occurred during the process of their domestication, focusing particularly on CpG-related mutations. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variations (CNVs) between RJF and these domesticated breeds were assessed in a reduced fraction of their genome. Additionally, DNA methylation in the same fraction of the genome was measured in the sperm of RJF individuals to identify possible correlations with the mutations found between RJF and the domesticated breeds. Our study shows that although the vast majority of CpG-related mutations found relate to CNVs, CpGs disproportionally associate to SNPs in comparison to CNVs, where they are indeed substantially under-represented. Moreover, CpGs seem to be hotspots of mutations related to speciation. We suggest that, on the one hand, CpG-related mutations in CNV regions would promote genomic `flexibility' in evolution, i.e., the ability of the genome to expand its functional possibilities; on the other hand, CpG-related mutations in SNPs would relate to genomic `specificity' in evolution, thus, representing mutations that would associate with phenotypic traits relevant for speciation.},

Kacser and Burns' metabolic theory provides a paradigmatic explanation for why most large-effect mutations are recessive. According to the metabolic theory, the recessivity of large-effect mutations is a consequence of a diminishing-returns relationship between flux through a metabolic pathway and enzymatic activity at any step in the pathway, which in turn is an inevitable consequence of long metabolic pathways. A major line of support for this theory was the demonstration of a negative correlation between homozygous effects and dominance of mutations in Drosophila, consistent with a central prediction of the metabolic theory. Using data on gene deletions in yeast, we show that a negative correlation between homozygous effects and dominance of mutations exists for all major categories of genes analyzed, not just those encoding enzymes. The relationship between dominance and homozygous effects is similar for duplicated and single-copy genes and for genes whose products are members of protein complexes and those that are not. A complete explanation of dominance therefore requires either a generalization of Kacser and Burns' theory to nonenzyme genes or a new theory.},

We also present the raw Pacific Biosciences continuous long-reads from which the assembly was created. A Hi-C dataset (Dovetail Genomics Omni-C) and Illumina-based RNAseq from eight tissues are also presented; the latter of which can be particularly useful for annotation and studies of freshwater tolerance.

Thus, bird nestlings are highly dependent on antibodies received from their mother (in the eggs) during their rapid early growth period. The relationship between maternal immunity and the development of neonates' own immunity has been poorly studied.                                                     It has been suggested that immune function plays an important part in mediating resource competition between different life-history traits, e.g. growth and reproduction. Maternal investment of antibodies has potentially permanent effects on offspring phenotype. Thus, the trade-offs between the immune function and other important life-history traits in the offspring will also affect the fitness of the mother.                                                                          Our supplemental feeding experiment in the magpie                     Pica pica                     indicates that the immunoglobulin levels of offspring at hatching are dependent on a mother's nutritional condition. In addition, the amount of maternal immunoglobulins transferred to offspring increases along the laying order within a nest.                                                                        We also found that at the age of 8--10~days the immunoglobulin production of the offspring has already begun. Furthermore, the maternal immunoglobulin levels of the offspring at hatching were positively related to their immunoglobulin levels on day 10.                                                     Maternal immunoglobulins did not significantly affect offspring growth, but there was a negative relationship between self-produced immunoglobulins and growth over the first 10~days, indicating a trade-off between these traits. Nestlings' weight, however, had a positive relationship with immunoglobulin production suggesting that the observed trade-off between growth and immunoglobulin production is due to catch-up growth of nestlings with a low hatching weight. We found that within nests nestlings with higher maternal antibody levels had higher survival rate until day 20, but between nests there was an opposite relationship.                                                     Evidently, there is a trade-off, in magpies, between maternal resources, immune function and growth, shaping the evolution of maternal investment in offspring immunity.},

However, the biology of transposable elements (TEs) suggests that such elements may also induce differential gene expression by affecting regulatory regions.                                                     We discuss the ecological and evolutionary relevance of epigenetic modifications versus transposon activity, taking into account that epigenetic modifications are generally reversible but that the modifications induced by TEs are stably inherited.                                                     We outline our perspective on the multiple roles played by environmental changes in the context of adaptive evolution. Environmental perturbations can induce phenotypic variations via epigenetic modulation of gene expression and promote, at the same time, genetic variability by triggering bursts of TE activity; finally, they select which genetic variations are most advantageous for survival.                                                     Within this context, the production of environmentally induced advantageous phenotypes by epigenetic mechanisms could represent an immediate process of adaptation followed by TE-induced genotypic changes that make these phenotypic variants heritable through the germ line. This scenario could lead TEs to play different roles in the function of the time-scale of ecological variation, such as those related to climatic change in the current context of global change.                                                     In conclusion, we propose that through TE activation, environmental changes can act as inducers of genetic variability, upon which they also act as selective forces, thus triggering rapid evolutionary processes.

  abstract = {While population declines can drive the loss of genetic diversity under some circumstances, it has been unclear whether this loss is a general consequence of overharvest in highly abundant marine fishes. We compiled data from 11 049 loci across 140 species and found that allelic richness was lower in overfished populations within 9 of 12 genera and families. A multiple linear regression showed that allelic richness was on average 12\% lower (P {$<$} 0.0001) in overharvested populations after accounting for the effects of body size, latitude and other factors. Heterozygosity was on average 2\% lower (P = 0.030). Simulations confirmed that these patterns are consistent with a recent bottleneck in abundant species and also showed that our analysis likely underestimates the loss of rare alleles by a factor of two or three. This evidence suggests that overharvest drives the decay of genetic diversity across a wide range of marine fishes. Such reductions of genetic diversity in some of the world's most abundant species may lead to a long-term impact of fishing on their evolutionary potential, particularly if abundance remains low and diversity continues to decay.

In turn, this reduces neutral diversity, and it also affects the genetic load of deleterious mutations. Here, we analyse the effect of such genomic erosion by designing a spatially explicit, individual based model in SLiM, simulating the effects of the recorded habitat loss in Mauritius over the past\,{\textasciitilde}\,250 years. We show that the loss of neutral diversity (genome-wide heterozygosity) was barely noticeable during the first 100 years of habitat loss. Changes to the genetic load took even more time to register, and they only became apparent circa 200 years after the start of habitat decline. Although a considerable number of deleterious mutations were lost by drift, others increased in frequency. The masked load was thus converted into a realised load, which compromised individual fitness and population viability after much of the native habitat had been lost. Importantly, genomic erosion continued after the metapopulation had stabilised at low numbers. Our study shows that historic habitat loss can pose a sustained threat to populations also in future generations, even without further habitat loss. The UN's Decade on Ecosystem Restoration needs to lead to transformative change to save species from future extinction, and this requires the urgent restoration of natural habitats.},

With the proliferation of videos posted online (e.g., on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter) for product reviews, movie reviews, political views, and more, affective computing research has increasingly evolved from conventional unimodal analysis to more complex forms of multimodal analysis. This is the primary motivation behind our first of its kind, comprehensive literature review of the diverse field of affective computing. Furthermore, existing literature surveys lack a detailed discussion of state of the art in multimodal affect analysis frameworks, which this review aims to address. Multimodality is defined by the presence of more than one modality or channel, e.g., visual, audio, text, gestures, and eye gage. In this paper, we focus mainly on the use of audio, visual and text information for multimodal affect analysis, since around 90\% of the relevant literature appears to cover these three modalities. Following an overview of different techniques for unimodal affect analysis, we outline existing methods for fusing information from different modalities. As part of this review, we carry out an extensive study of different categories of state-of-the-art fusion techniques, followed by a critical analysis of potential performance improvements with multimodal analysis compared to unimodal analysis. A comprehensive overview of these two complementary fields aims to form the building blocks for readers, to better understand this challenging and exciting research field.},

In Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes, parental responses can transmit heritable small RNAs that regulate gene expression transgenerationally. In this study, we show that a neuronal process can impact the next generations. Neuronsspecific synthesis of RDE-4-dependent small RNAs regulates germline amplified endogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and germline gene expression for multiple generations. Further, the production of small RNAs in neurons controls the chemotaxis behavior of the progeny for at least three generations via the germline Argonaute HRDE-1. Among the targets of these small RNAs, we identified the conserved gene saeg-2, which is transgenerationally downregulated in the germline. Silencing of saeg-2 following neuronal small RNA biogenesis is required for chemotaxis under stress. Thus, we propose a small-RNA-based mechanism for communication of neuronal processes transgenerationally.},

  abstract = {Inbreeding depression can reduce the viability of wild populations. Detecting inbreeding depression in the wild is difficult; developing accurate estimates of inbreeding can be time and labor intensive. In this study, we used a two-step modeling procedure to incorporate uncertainty inherent in estimating individual inbreeding coefficients from multilocus genotypes into estimates of inbreeding depression in a population of Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii). The two-step modeling procedure presented in this paper provides a method for estimating the magnitude of a known source of error, which is assumed absent in classic regression models, and incorporating this error into inferences about inbreeding depression. The method is essentially an errors-in-variables regression with non-normal errors in both the dependent and independent variables. These models, therefore, allow for a better evaluation of the uncertainty surrounding the biological importance of inbreeding depression in non-pedigreed wild populations. For this study we genotyped 154 adult female seals from the population in Erebus Bay, Antarctica, at 29 microsatellite loci, 12 of which are novel. We used a statistical evidence approach to inference rather than hypothesis testing because the discovery of both low and high levels of inbreeding are of scientific interest. We found evidence for an absence of inbreeding depression in lifetime reproductive success, adult survival, age at maturity, and the reproductive interval of female seals in this population.},

  abstract = {Background: Although around 1\% of cytosines in bees' genomes are known to be methylated, less is known about methylation's effect on bee behavior and fitness. Chemically altered DNA methylation levels have shown clear changes in the dominance and reproductive behavior of workers in queen-less colonies, but the global effect of DNA methylation on caste determination and colony development remains unclear, mainly because of difficulties in controlling for genetic differences among experimental subjects in the parental line. Here, we investigated the effect of the methylation altering agent decitabine on the developmental rate of full bumblebee colonies. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing was used to assess differences in methylation status. Results: Our results showed fewer methylated loci in the control group. A total of 22 CpG loci were identified as significantly differentially methylated between treated and control workers with a change in methylation levels of 10\% or more. Loci that were methylated differentially between groups participated in pathways including neuron function, oocyte regulation and metabolic processes. Treated colonies tended to develop faster, and therefore more workers were found at a given developmental stage. However, male production followed the opposite trend and it tended to be higher in control colonies. Conclusion: Overall, our results indicate that altered methylation patterns resulted in an improved cooperation between workers, while there were no signs of abnormal worker dominance or caste determination.},

  abstract = {Background: The only known albino gorilla, named Snowflake, was a male wild born individual from Equatorial Guinea who lived at the Barcelona Zoo for almost 40 years. He was diagnosed with non-syndromic oculocutaneous albinism, i.e. white hair, light eyes, pink skin, photophobia and reduced visual acuity. Despite previous efforts to explain the genetic cause, this is still unknown. Here, we study the genetic cause of his albinism and making use of whole genome sequencing data we find a higher inbreeding coefficient compared to other gorillas. Results: We successfully identified the causal genetic variant for Snowflake's albinism, a non-synonymous single nucleotide variant located in a transmembrane region of SLC45A2. This transporter is known to be involved in oculocutaneous albinism type 4 (OCA4) in humans. We provide experimental evidence that shows that this amino acid replacement alters the membrane spanning capability of this transmembrane region. Finally, we provide a comprehensive study of genome-wide patterns of autozygogosity revealing that Snowflake's parents were related, being this the first report of inbreeding in a wild born Western lowland gorilla. Conclusions: In this study we demonstrate how the use of whole genome sequencing can be extended to link genotype and phenotype in non-model organisms and it can be a powerful tool in conservation genetics (e.g., inbreeding and genetic diversity) with the expected decrease in sequencing cost.},

We assume a model in which there are K populations (where K may be unknown), each of which is characterized by a set of allele frequencies at each locus. Individuals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically) to populations, or jointly to two or more populations if their genotypes indicate that they are admixed. Our model does not assume a particular mutation process, and it can be applied to most of the commonly used genetic markers, provided that they are not closely linked. Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and admixed individuals. We show that the method can produce highly accurate assignments using modest numbers of loci---e.g., seven microsatellite loci in an example using genotype data from an endangered bird species.

  abstract = {The genic capture hypothesis implies that the expression of sexual ornaments largely depends on genes affecting resource acquisition and use. The ornaments should thus show high degree of directional dominance typical of life-history traits, and consequently, they should be severely affected by inbreeding. Here we investigated the effect of inbreeding on a sexual ornament (male eyespan) in stalk-eyed fly, Teleopsis dalmanni. For comparison, we also measured inbreeding depression in non-sexual morphological traits: female eyespan as well as wing and thorax lengths in both sexes. Both eyespan, and other morphological traits we measured, showed significant inbreeding depression. In accord with predictions of genic capture hypothesis, male eyespan did decrease under inbreeding significantly more than female eyespan. However, the decline in male eyespan was fully explained by overall decline in body length. Moreover, the magnitude of inbreeding depression in male eyespan was considerably lower than that typically observed for lifehistories; in fact, it fitted within the range typically characterizing morphological traits. We therefore conclude that our results provide weak support for genic capture hypothesis.},

Under inbreeding, this could promote purging selection, that is the removal of deleterious recessive alleles exposed in homozygotes via matings between closely related individuals. Here, in two independent experiments, we found no evidence for short-term purging of the inbreeding load from severely bottlenecked populations of red flour beetles,               Tribolium castaneum               . We hypothesize that sexual selection may have dual effects on purging, corresponding to good-genes               versus               compatible-genes mechanisms. Whereas the former should facilitate the removal of inbreeding load from bottlenecked populations, the latter may actually hamper this process while simultaneously limiting inbreeding depression by preventing the expression of deleterious recessives.},

However, the transferring of effluents from farms to the treatment plant and back to farms, as well as the treatment operations themselves, must be carefully evaluated to assure the environmental sustainability of the solution. This study evaluated the global warming potential (GWP) and acidification potential (AP) of a collective treatment plant for bioenergy production and nitrogen removal as an alternative strategy to conventional on-farm manure management systems. Two manure management scenarios were compared: manure management on individual farms and management by a collective treatment plant. Data were collected at a collective processing plant and at the individual farms of the consortium to estimate emissions of CO2, CH4, N2O, NOx, NH3 and SO2. The plant receives manure from 21 livestock production units, treating 660 tonnes day-1 of manure. The GWP and AP indicators were calculated to evaluate the potential impact of the two management solutions. The collective solution reduced both GWP (-52\%) and AP (-43\%) compared to manure management separately by each farm. Further improvement might be obtained in both indicators by introducing mitigation techniques in farm manure storage and manure application to soil.},

They have been utilized as scavengers to consume the production which could not otherwise be marketed at a better return. Livestock systems were typically very small holdings and were cared for in the odd time that the farmer would have from tending crops. This has been referred to as chores. The chores were done in the morning before field work and in the evening after return from the field. There was slow change in this system or in the pattern of production until after World War II. Since that time because of the shifts in population and the desire for better living conditions that could be afforded in urban areas livestock production has been systemized. Dairy production was one of the first livestock operations to be mechanized. Perhaps this is due to the milking operation being one of the most odious chores which had to be performed in livestock production. The milking machine was a very welcome addition to the farm industry.},

The extent and frequency of ROHs may inform on the ancestry of an individual and its population. Here we use high density (n = 777,962) bi-allelic SNPs in a range of cattle breed samples to correlate ROH with the pedigree-based inbreeding coefficients and to validate subsequent analyses using 54,001 SNP genotypes. This study provides a first testing of the inference drawn from ROH through comparison with estimates of inbreeding from calculations based on the detailed pedigree data available for several breeds. Results: All animals genotyped on the HD panel displayed at least one ROH that was between 1--5 Mb in length with certain regions of the genome more likely to be involved in a ROH than others. Strong correlations (r = 0.75, p {$<$} 0.0001) existed between the pedigree-based inbreeding coefficient and a statistic based on sum of ROH of length {$>$} 0.5 KB and suggests that in the absence of an animal's pedigree data, the extent of a genome under ROH may be used to infer aspects of recent population history even from relatively few samples. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that ROH are frequent across all breeds but differing patterns of ROH length and burden illustrate variations in breed origins and recent management.},

Here, we describe a simpler approach (``Chicago'') based on in vitro reconstituted chromatin. We generated two Chicago data sets with human DNA and developed a statistical model and a new software pipeline (``HiRise'') that can identify poor quality joins and produce accurate, long-range sequence scaffolds. We used these to construct a highly accurate de novo assembly and scaffolding of a human genome with scaffold N50 of 20 Mbp. We also demonstrated the utility of Chicago for improving existing assemblies by reassembling and scaffolding the genome of the American alligator. With a single library and one lane of Illumina HiSeq sequencing, we increased the scaffold N50 of the American alligator from 508 kbp to 10 Mbp.},

However, searching for overlaps between features with existing web-based methods is complicated by the massive datasets that are routinely produced with current sequencing technologies. Fast and flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex questions of these data in an efficient manner.             Results: This article introduces a new software suite for the comparison, manipulation and annotation of genomic features in Browser Extensible Data (BED) and General Feature Format (GFF) format. BEDTools also supports the comparison of sequence alignments in BAM format to both BED and GFF features. The tools are extremely efficient and allow the user to compare large datasets (e.g. next-generation sequencing data) with both public and custom genome annotation tracks. BEDTools can be combined with one another as well as with standard UNIX commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks as well as pipelines that can quickly answer intricate questions of large genomic datasets.             Availability and implementation: BEDTools was written in C++.

Whether academics attend in-\-person conferences is based on the cost, accessibility, and safety of the event. Therefore, in-p\- erson conferences are less accessible to academics and stakeholders that are unable to overcome some of these factors, which then act as a barrier to equal and inclusive participation. Additionally, the carbon footprint of conference travel is increasingly becoming a factor in deciding on whether to attend a conference. Online conferences may provide opportunities to mitigate these challenges. Here, we illustrate how a learned society can move their conference online. Then, comparing data acquired from the virtual conference and previous in-p\- erson conferences, we explore the aids and barriers influencing the decision of delegates to attend the meetings. Ultimately, moving meetings online aids delegate participation by removing concerns about travel, cost, and carbon emissions, but there remains a barrier to participation as online meetings are perceived as less effective for networking and social opportunities.},

In recent years, condition-dependent sex has been studied both theoretically and empirically. Empirical results in microbes, fungi and plants support the theoretical prediction that negative condition-dependent sex, in which individuals in poor condition are more likely to reproduce sexually, can be evolutionarily advantageous under a wide range of settings. Here, we review the evidence for condition-dependent sex and its potential implications for the long-term survival and adaptability of populations. We conclude by asking why condition-dependent sex is not more commonly observed, and by considering generalizations of condition-dependent sex that might apply even for obligate sexuals.

  abstract = {Lekking is a spectacular mating system in which males maintain tightly organized clustering of territories during the mating season, and females visit these leks for mating. Various hypotheses---ranging from predation dilution to mate choice and mating benefit---offer potential explanations for the evolution of this peculiar mating system. However, many of these classic hypotheses rarely consider the spatial dynamics that produce and maintain the lek. In this article, we propose to view lekking through the perspective of collective behaviour, in which simple local interactions between organisms, as well as habitat, likely produce and maintain lekking. Further, we argue that interactions within the leks change over time, typically over a breeding season, to produce many broad-level as well as specific collective patterns. To test these ideas at both proximate and ultimate levels, we argue that the concepts and tools from the literature on collective animal behaviour, such as agent-based models and high-resolution video tracking that enables capturing fine-scale spatio-temporal interactions, could be useful. To demonstrate the promise of these ideas, we develop a spatially explicit agent-based model and show how simple rules such as spatial fidelity, local social interactions and repulsion among males can potentially explain the formation of lek and synchronous departures of males for foraging from the lek. On the empirical side, we discuss the promise of applying the collective behaviour approach to blackbuck (               Antilope cervicapra               ) leks---using high-resolution recordings via a camera fitted to unmanned aerial vehicles and subsequent tracking of animal movements. Broadly, we suggest that a lens of collective behaviour may provide novel insights into understanding both the proximate and ultimate factors that shape leks.                          This article is part of a discussion meeting issue `Collective behaviour through time'.},

  abstract = {Mathematical models are used to explore the evolutionary and demographic consequences of size-selective harvesting and natural selection in populations with discrete, nonoverlapping generations. We specify the harvesting intensity and size selectivity in terms of both the phenotypic criterion for harvesting and the demographic goal of harvesting. The phenotypic criterion is defined by a threshold that specifies the minimum size of individuals harvested, while the demographic goal defines the desired catch or escapement from the harvest. Models use either a constant phenotypic threshold, or a variable phenotypic threshold that moves each year to remain a fixed distance from the mean size prior to harvest. Demographic goals are defined as a desired yield or escapement, measured in abundance or biomass. We find that all combinations of phenotypic criteria and demographic goals can produce evolutionary changes in equilibrium mean size and abundance when harvesting is size selective. Reductions in mean size are more severe under harvesting scenarios for which it is not possible to fully satisfy the demographic goals of harvesting at equilibrium. Models with a variable phenotypic threshold always produce a characteristic equilibrium for mean size and abundance for a given set of harvesting and natural selection parameters, regardless of the initial population characteristics. For some combinations of parameters, constant-threshold models produce alternative equilibria for the mean size and abundance. Our results suggest that the evolutionary effects of selective harvesting warrant consideration in long-term conservation and management planning.},

Changes in size of pintail breeding populations were most strongly related to spring habitat conditions, especially when populations were small and spring seasons were wet, but changes were also related to winter habitat conditions when spring seasons were dry. Harvest variables, regardless of hunting regulations, were less related to changes in numbers of breeding pintails than habitat variables. Age-ratios harvested in the United States (index of recruitment) were most related to breeding habitat conditions when spring seasons were dry and populations small, but age-ratios were most related to winter habitat conditions the previous year when followed by wet spring seasons and very large population sizes. Harvest variables were not related to pintail recruitment except in years following dry winters when harvest rates of adults were higher and subsequent age-ratios lower. However, recruitment following dry winters was even more strongly related to spring habitat conditions than to harvest variables the previous winter. Numbers of pintails harvested by hunters were most related to population size. We conclude that maintenance and quality of late winter habitat deserves more management emphasis than previously recognized.},

Such sample augmentation or ``               N               -hacking'' is condemned because it can lead to an excess of false positives, which can reduce the reproducibility of results. However, the scenarios used to prove this rule tend to be unrealistic, assuming the addition of unlimited extra samples to achieve statistical significance, or doing so when results are not even close to significant; an unlikely situation for most experiments involving patient samples, cultured cells, or live animals. If we were to examine some more realistic scenarios, could there be any situations where               N               -hacking might be an acceptable practice? This Essay aims to address this question, using simulations to demonstrate how               N               -hacking causes false positives and to investigate whether this increase is still relevant when using parameters based on real-life experimental settings.},

Genetic approaches have largely contributed to conservation biology by defining ``conservation entities'' accounting for their evolutionary history and adaptive potential, the so-called                     evolutionary significant units                     (ESUs). Yet, these approaches only loosely integrate the short-term ecological history of organisms.                                                                        Here, we argue that epigenetic variation, and more particularly DNA methylation, represents a molecular component of biodiversity that directly links the genome to the environment. As such, it provides the required information on the ecological background of organisms for an integrative field of conservation biology.                                                     We synthesize knowledge about the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in (a) orchestrating fundamental development alternatives in organisms, (b) enabling individuals to respond in real-time to selection pressures and (c) improving ecosystem stability and functioning.                                                     Using practical examples in conservation biology, we illustrate the relevance of DNA methylation (a) as biomarkers of past and present environmental stress events as well as biomarkers of physiological conditions of individuals; (b) for documenting the ecological structuring/clustering of wild populations and hence for better integrating ecology into ESUs; (c) for improving conservation translocations; and (d) for studying landscape functional connectivity.                                                                          We conclude that an                     epigenetic conservation                     perspective will provide environmental managers the possibility to refine ESUs, to set conservation plans taking into account the capacity of organisms to rapidly cope with environmental changes, and hence to improve the conservation of wild populations.

  abstract = {Variation in female behaviour has only recently received attention in studies of sexual selection. It has been suggested that females may invest differentially in their offspring in relation to the quality of their mate. This may lead to females that mate with high-quality and/or attractive males laying larger clutches. Females may also differ in their ability to choose between males. For example, females in good physical condition may make better choices. If physical condition and clutch size are positively correlated, this hypothesis could also produce a relationship between male attractiveness and female clutch size. We found, in lekking black grouse, Tetrao tetrix, that females mated to the highest ranked males laid the largest clutches. Furthermore we found, regardless of female age, a positive relationship between a measure of female condition and male rank but not between female condition and her clutch size. In addition, females in good condition visited a larger number of different male territories, and old females produced the largest clutches. Our results suggest two mechanisms to explain our findings. First, females in good physical condition tend to mate with the top males, suggesting an assortative mating pattern. Second, females mating with the highest ranked males lay larger clutches as a consequence of their choice. In general, our result calls for caution in evaluating studies that look at the consequences of mate choice. It may be that differences in female quality produce effects that may be wrongly interpreted as male quality effects.},

Given that many organisms face ongoing threats of extinction, there is interest in elucidating the impact of deleterious variation on extinction risk and optimizing management strategies accounting for such mutations. Quantifying deleterious variation and understanding the effects of population history on deleterious variation are complex endeavors because we do not know the strength of selection acting on each mutation. Further, the effect of demographic history on deleterious mutations depends on the strength of selection against the mutation and the degree of dominance. Here we clarify how deleterious variation can be quantified and studied in natural populations. We then discuss how different demographic factors, such as small population size, nonequilibrium population size changes, inbreeding, and gene flow, affect deleterious variation. Lastly, we provide guidance on studying deleterious variation in nonmodel populations of conservation concern.},

Much less attention is directed at understanding the landscape of deleterious variation, an insidious consequence of geographic isolation and the inefficiency of natural selection to eliminate harmful variants in small populations [3--5]. With population sizes of many vertebrates decreasing and isolation increasing through habitat fragmentation and loss, understanding the extent and nature of deleterious variation in small populations is essential for predicting and enhancing population persistence. The Channel Island fox (Urocyon littoralis) is a dwarfed species that inhabits six of California's Channel Islands and is derived from the mainland gray fox (U. cinereoargenteus). These isolated island populations have persisted for thousands of years at extremely small population sizes [6, 7] and, consequently, are a model for testing ideas about the accumulation of deleterious variation in small populations under natural conditions. Analysis of complete genome sequence data from island foxes shows a dramatic decrease in genome-wide variation and a sharp increase in the homozygosity of deleterious variants. The San Nicolas Island population has a near absence of variation, demonstrating a unique genetic flatlining that is punctuated by heterozygosity hotspots, enriched for olfactory receptor genes and other genes with high levels of ancestral variation. These findings question the generality of the small-population paradigm that maintains substantial genetic variation is necessary for short- and long-term persistence.},

However, investigating the genome-wide dynamics associated with inbreeding depression in natural populations is only now feasible with relatively inexpensive sequencing technology and annotated reference genomes. To characterize the genome-wide effects of intense inbreeding and isolation, we performed whole-genome sequencing and morphological analysis of an iconic inbred population, the gray wolves (               Canis lupus               ) of Isle Royale. Through population genetic simulations and comparison with wolf genomes from a variety of demographic histories, we find evidence that severe inbreeding depression in this population is due to increased homozygosity of strongly deleterious recessive mutations. Our results have particular relevance in light of the recent translocation of wolves from the mainland to Isle Royale, as well as broader implications for management of genetic variation in the fragmented landscape of the modern world.},

However, empirical work typically focuses only on allocation despite the fact that relationships between fitness components may be governed by differences in the ability of individuals to acquire resources across environments. Here, we outline a statistical framework to partition the genetic basis of multivariate plasticity into independent axes of genetic variation, and quantify for the first time, the extent to which specific traits drive multitrait genotype--environment interactions. Our framework generalises to analyses of plasticity, growth and ageing. We apply this approach to a unique, large-scale, multivariate study of acquisition, allocation and plasticity in the life history of the cricket,               Gryllus firmus               . We demonstrate that resource acquisition and allocation are genetically correlated, and that plasticity in trade-offs between allocation to components of fitness is 90\% dependent on genetic variance for total resource acquisition. These results suggest that genotype--environment effects for resource acquisition can maintain variation in life-history components that are typically observed in the wild.},

I then examined whether experiencing gender bias was associated with lower STEM self-concept and, if so, whether having a supportive network of STEM peers would buffer this effect. Data were collected through a self-report survey that was administered to high school girls who aspired to have STEM careers, women in STEM undergraduate majors, and women in STEM doctoral programs. Overall, 61\% of participants reported experiencing gender bias in the past year, but the prevalence rate varied according to their phase of education and field of study. In particular, women in math-intensive undergraduate majors were especially likely to encounter gender bias, which predominately originated from male peers in their major. As expected, participants who encountered gender bias had lower STEM selfconcept than participants who did not. However, this effect was attenuated for participants who also had a supportive network of STEM peers. These findings suggest that positive peer connections may be a valuable resource for girls and women in the STEM pipeline.},

  abstract = {Significance             Meiotic recombination is known to vary over 1,000-fold in many eukaryotic organisms, including maize. This regional genomic variation has enormous consequences for plant breeders, who rely on meiotic cross-overs to fine-map quantitative traits and introgress favorable alleles. Deleterious mutations are also predicted to accumulate preferentially within low-recombination regions, particularly within historically outcrossing species, such as maize. Here, we show that meiotic recombination is predictable across diverse crosses based on several genomic features of the reference genome. We demonstrate that the extant patterns of recombination are historically stable and tied to variation in the number of deleterious mutations. The ability of plant breeders to exploit recombination to purge segregating deleterious alleles will determine the efficacy of future crop improvement.           ,              Among the fundamental evolutionary forces, recombination arguably has the largest impact on the practical work of plant breeders. Varying over 1,000-fold across the maize genome, the local meiotic recombination rate limits the resolving power of quantitative trait mapping and the precision of favorable allele introgression. The consequences of low recombination also theoretically extend to the species-wide scale by decreasing the power of selection relative to genetic drift, and thereby hindering the purging of deleterious mutations. In this study, we used genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) to identify 136,000 recombination breakpoints at high resolution within US and Chinese maize nested association mapping populations. We find that the pattern of cross-overs is highly predictable on the broad scale, following the distribution of gene density and CpG methylation. Several large inversions also suppress recombination in distinct regions of several families. We also identify recombination hotspots ranging in size from 1 kb to 30 kb. We find these hotspots to be historically stable and, compared with similar regions with low recombination, to have strongly differentiated patterns of DNA methylation and GC content. We also provide evidence for the historical action of GC-biased gene conversion in recombination hotspots. Finally, using genomic evolutionary rate profiling (GERP) to identify putative deleterious polymorphisms, we find evidence for reduced genetic load in hotspot regions, a phenomenon that may have considerable practical importance for breeding programs worldwide.},

  abstract = {Judgment bias tasks (JBTs) are considered as a family of promising tools in the assessment of emotional states of animals. JBTs provide a cognitive measure of optimism and/or pessimism by recording behavioral responses to ambiguous stimuli. For instance, a negative emotional state is expected to produce a negative or pessimistic judgment of an ambiguous stimulus, whereas a positive emotional state produces a positive or optimistic judgment of the same ambiguous stimulus. Measuring an animal's emotional state or mood is relevant in both animal welfare research and biomedical research. This is reflected in the increasing use of JBTs in both research areas. We discuss the different implementations of JBTs with animals, with a focus on their potential as an accurate measure of emotional state. JBTs have been successfully applied to a very broad range of species, using many different types of testing equipment and experimental protocols. However, further validation of this test is deemed necessary. For example, the often extensive training period required for successful judgment bias testing remains a possible factor confounding results. Also, the issue of ambiguous stimuli losing their ambiguity with repeated testing requires additional attention. Possible improvements are suggested to further develop the JBTs in both animal welfare and biomedical research.},

Recent breakthroughs in ancient DNA sequencing have allowed for complete genome sequencing for two specimens of woolly mammoths (Palkopoulou et al. 2015). One mammoth specimen is from a mainland population 45,000 years ago when mammoths were plentiful. The second, a 4300 yr old specimen, is derived from an isolated population on Wrangel island where mammoths subsisted with small effective population size more than 43-fold lower than previous populations. These extreme differences in effective population size offer a rare opportunity to test nearly neutral models of genome architecture evolution within a single species. Using these previously published mammoth sequences, we identify deletions, retrogenes, and non-functionalizing point mutations. In the Wrangel island mammoth, we identify a greater number of deletions, a larger proportion of deletions affecting gene sequences, a greater number of candidate retrogenes, and an increased number of premature stop codons. This accumulation of detrimental mutations is consistent with genomic meltdown in response to low effective population sizes in the dwindling mammoth population on Wrangel island. In addition, we observe high rates of loss of olfactory receptors and urinary proteins, either because these loci are non-essential or because they were favored by divergent selective pressures in island environments. Finally, at the locus of FOXQ1 we observe two independent loss-of-function mutations, which would confer a satin coat phenotype in this island woolly mammoth.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Variants within non-coding genomic regions can greatly affect disease. In recent years, increasing focus has been given to these variants, and how they can alter regulatory elements, such as enhancers, transcription factor binding sites and DNA methylation regions. Such variants can be considered regulatory variants. Concurrently, much effort has been put into establishing international consortia to undertake large projects aimed at discovering regulatory elements in different tissues, cell lines and organisms, and probing the effects of genetic variants on regulation by measuring gene expression. Here, we describe methods and techniques for discovering disease-associated non-coding variants using sequencing technologies. We then explain the computational procedures that can be used for annotating these variants using the information from the aforementioned projects, and prediction of their putative effects, including potential pathogenicity, based on rule-based and machine learning approaches. We provide the details of techniques to validate these predictions, by mapping chromatin--chromatin and chromatin--protein interactions, and introduce Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats-Associated Protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) technology, which has already been used in this field and is likely to have a big impact on its future evolution.             We also give examples of regulatory variants associated with multiple complex diseases. This review is aimed at bioinformaticians interested in the characterization of regulatory variants, molecular biologists and geneticists interested in understanding more about the nature and potential role of such variants from a functional point of views, and clinicians who may wish to learn about variants in non-coding genomic regions associated with a given disease and find out what to do next to uncover how they impact on the underlying mechanisms.},

Literature gives insufficient anchor points to estimate the value of information (VOI) obtained with PLF technologies. This study proposes a conceptual framework with building blocks to determine the VOI. Next, the framework is used to describe factors and existing gaps in the VOI assessment. This, finally, leads to reflections and recommendations about how to assess and improve the VOI of PLF. Literature reveals that the VOI surpasses the mere use of more precise information to take decisions, but encompasses a path from data collection to decisions with particular outcomes. The framework interlinks three building blocks: (i) data processing, (ii) decision making and (iii) impact analysis with factors influencing the VOI such as the process to transform data into information, level of precision, decision rules, social influences, the accuracy of information, herd size and prevalence of the condition measured. Besides profitability, outcomes from decisions include the impact on animal welfare, environment, food safety, and food security. The data-to-value framework allows for a better assessment of VOI and its potentials, and provides anchor points to design useful and valuable PLF technologies. The framework also helps to determine the role of advisors in interpreting the more precise information and in formulating farmer-tailored advice to apply the most optimal practices. Both technology design and advisors' role may enhance the VOI of future PLF developments and applications.},

  abstract = {Context. Despite their economic importance and intensive management, many game bird species, including the northern bobwhite Colinus virginianus, are in decline. Declines may be explained, at least in part, by low survival due perhaps to poor habitat quality, high predation or excessive hunting pressure. Aims. This study sought to estimate and model annual/seasonal survival probabilities, to evaluate factors influencing them and to determine the cause-specific mortality rates for northern bobwhites subject to varying levels of harvest on the Babcock--Webb Wildlife Management Area (BW area), south Florida, USA. Methods. We applied Cox's proportional hazard models to data collected from 2066 radio-tagged bobwhites during 2002--2008 to test for intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting survival and the non-parametric cumulative incidence function estimator to estimate cause-specific mortality rates. Key results. Mean annual survival (0.091 {\textpm} 0.006) in the BW area was lower than most estimates reported for other bobwhite populations. Annual survival differed between adults (0.111 {\textpm} 0.008) and juveniles (0.052 {\textpm} 0.008), and varied among years. Survival in winter (October--March; 0.295 {\textpm} 0.014) was similar to that in summer (April--September; 0.307 {\textpm} 0.013). Density of food strips (i.e. long and narrow food plots) did not influence survival, but hunting effort (number of hunters per day per km2) had a substantial negative impact on survival. In the lightly hunted field trial zone, winter (October--March) survival was significantly higher (0.414 {\textpm} 0.035) than in the other more heavily hunted management zones (0.319 {\textpm} 0.016). Cause-specific mortality analyses revealed that bobwhite mortality during summer (April--September) was mainly due to raptor (39.7\%) and mammalian predation (35.6\%), whereas hunting was the primary cause of mortality during winter (47.1\%). Conclusions. Our results highlight the potential role of harvest as an important cause of the northern bobwhite population declines in south Florida. High mortality during winter may reduce recruitment of juveniles to the reproductive segment of the population, and ultimately the population growth. Implications. Our results suggest that reduction in hunting pressure may be necessary to reverse the declining population trends in heavily hunted game species in public lands, such as the northern bobwhites in the BW area.},

Furthermore, we investigated whether the potential trust-damaging effects of research being funded privately (e.g. by a commercial enterprise) may be buffered by such practices. After preregistering six hypotheses, we conducted a survey study (Study 1; N\,=\,504) and an experimental study (Study 2; N\,=\,588) in two German general population samples. In both studies, we found evidence for the positive effects of open science practices on trust, though it should be noted that in Study 2, results were more inconsistent. We did not however find evidence for the aforementioned buffering effect. We conclude that while open science practices may contribute to increasing trust in science, the importance of making use of open science practices visible should not be underestimated.},

Fish were fed a formulated diet containing 32\% crude protein and 13 MJ/kg energy and cultured for 210 days. Water temperatures ranged from 20.6 to 29.8 8C. There was aggression between fish in cages stocked at 25 or 50 fish/m3 and survival (50\% and 64.5\%, respectively) was significantly lower ( P b 0.01) than at the other densities (87.5\%, 98.5\% and 97.4\%). Stocking density did not affect final weight (454.6--471.1 g), specific growth rate (0.65--0.70\%/day) or absolute growth rate (1.6--1.7 g/fish/day), but feed conversion ratios (FCR) of fish stocked at 25 or 50 fish/m3 (4.4 and 3.7) were significantly higher ( P b 0.01) than FCRs (range, 2.3--2.5) at other densities. Coefficients of variation in weight (CV) at 25 or 50 fish/m3 (24.4\% and 28.3\%) were significantly higher ( P b 0.01) than at other densities and the lowest CV of 16.1\% was at 200 fish/m3. Production was significantly affected ( P b 0.01) by stocking density, with the highest mean rate of 88.5 kg/m3 in cages stocked with 200 fish/m3. One infestation of the ectoparasitic ciliate, Chilodonella hexasticha, and two infestations of the monogenean gill fluke, Lepidotrema bidyana, were each treated successfully with an application of 30 mg/l formalin. The high survival, relatively fast growth, low variation in weight and high production rates of silver perch stocked at 100 or 200 fish/m3 demonstrate that cages are a viable alternative to ponds for the commercial production of silver perch.},

They were kept on litter in separate boxes, with 25 individuals of one breed per box, in the same building. An open field test was used in determining the behaviour of the birds. Levels of cortisol in serum and corticosterone in feathers were evaluated, and haematological and biochemical analyses of blood were performed. Leghorns proved to be a highly excitable and active breed whose needs cannot be fully satisfied in the standard conditions of large farms. Based on a differential leukocyte count, their hyperactivity was associated with increased stress. The Green-legged partridge exhibited the lowest stress levels. Birds kept in the same environmental conditions were found to differ significantly in the level of stress, probably because of differences in their behavioural needs and the possibilities of satisfying them. To reduce stress levels and improve the welfare of hens, it is necessary to verify their preferences first. Stress indicators are elevated in highly excitable birds, and the conditions on large farms are not conducive to meeting their behavioural needs.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             Although the long-lasting effects of variation in early-life environment have been well documented across organisms, the underlying causal mechanisms are only recently starting to be unraveled. Yet understanding the underlying mechanisms of long-lasting effects can help us predict how organisms will respond to changing environments. Birds offer a great system in which to study developmental plasticity and its underlying mechanisms owing to the production of large external eggs and variation in developmental trajectories, combined with a long tradition of applied, physiological, ecological and evolutionary research. Epigenetic changes (such as DNA methylation) have been suggested to be a key mechanism mediating long-lasting effects of the early-life environment across taxa. More recently, changes in the early-life gut microbiome have been identified as another potential mediator of developmental plasticity. As a first step in understanding whether these mechanisms contribute to developmental plasticity in birds, this Review summarizes how changes in early-life environment (both prenatal and postnatal) influence epigenetic markers and the gut microbiome. The literature shows how both early-life biotic (such as resources and social environment) and abiotic (thermal environment and various anthropogenic stressors) factors modify epigenetic markers and the gut microbiome in birds, yet data concerning many other environmental factors are limited. The causal links of these modifications to lasting phenotypic changes are still scarce, but changes in the hypothalamic--pituitary--adrenal axis have been identified as one putative pathway. This Review identifies several knowledge gaps, including data on the long-term effects, stability of the molecular changes, and lack of diversity in the systems studied, and provides directions for future research.},

Immunological changes originating during reproduction may help explain some of these relationships.                                         Methodology               To explore the potential role of the immune system in female CoR, we characterized leukocyte composition and regulatory processes using DNA methylation (DNAm) in a cross-sectional cohort of young (20--22 years old) women differing in reproductive status.                                         Results               Compared to nulliparity, pregnancy was characterized by differential methylation at 828 sites, 96\% of which were hypomethylated and enriched for genes associated with T-cell activation, innate immunity, pre-eclampsia and neoplasia. Breastfeeding was associated with differential methylation at 1107 sites (71\% hypermethylated), enriched for genes involved in metabolism, immune self-recognition and neurogenesis. There were no significant differences in DNAm between nulliparous and parous women. However, compared to nullipara, pregnant women had lower proportions of B, CD4T, CD8T and natural killer (NK) cells, and higher proportions of granulocytes and monocytes. Monocyte counts were lower and NK counts higher among breastfeeding women, and remained so among parous women.                                         Implications               Our findings point to widespread differences in DNAm during pregnancy and lactation. These effects appear largely transient, but may accumulate with gravidity become detectable as women age. Nulliparous and parous women differed in leukocyte composition, consistent with more persistent effects of reproduction on cell type. These findings support transient (leukocyte DNAm) and persistent (cell composition) changes associated with reproduction in women, illuminating potential pathways contributing to CoR.               Lay Summary: Evolutionary theory and epidemiology support costs of reproduction (CoR) to women's health that may involve changes in immune function. We report differences in immune cell composition and gene regulation during pregnancy and breastfeeding. While many of these differences appear transient, immune cell composition may remain, suggesting mechanisms for female CoR.},

  abstract = {We analyse how migration from a large mainland influences genetic load and population numbers on an island, in a scenario where fitness-affecting variants are unconditionally deleterious, and where numbers decline with increasing load. Our analysis shows that migration can have qualitatively different effects, depending on the total mutation target and fitness effects of deleterious variants. In particular, we find that populations exhibit a genetic Allee effect across a wide range of parameter combinations, when variants are partially recessive, cycling between low-load (large-population) and high-load (sink) states. Increased migration reduces load in the sink state (by increasing heterozygosity) but further inflates load in the large-population state (by hindering purging). We identify various critical parameter thresholds at which one or other stable state collapses, and discuss how these thresholds are influenced by the genetic versus demographic effects of migration. Our analysis is based on a `semi-deterministic' analysis, which accounts for genetic drift but neglects demographic stochasticity. We also compare against simulations which account for both demographic stochasticity and drift. Our results clarify the importance of gene flow as a key determinant of extinction risk in peripheral populations, even in the absence of ecological gradients.

  abstract = {Although life-history trade-offs are central to life-history evolution, their mechanistic basis is often unclear. Traditionally, trade-offs are understood in terms of competition for limited resources among traits within an organism, which could be mediated by signal transduction pathways at the level of cellular metabolism. Nevertheless, trade-offs are also thought to be produced as a consequence of the performance of one activity generating negative consequences for other traits, or the result of genes or pathways that simultaneously regulate two life-history traits in opposite directions (antagonistic pleiotropy), independent of resource allocation. Yet examples of genes with antagonistic effects on life-history traits are limited. This study provides direct evidence for a gene---               RLS1               , that is involved in increasing survival in nutrient-limiting environments at a cost to immediate reproduction in the single-celled photosynthetic alga,               Chlamydomonas reinhardtii               . Specifically, we show that RLS1 mutants are unable to properly suppress their reproduction in phosphate-deprived conditions. Although these mutants have an immediate reproductive advantage relative to the parental strain, their long-term survival is negatively affected. Our data suggest that               RLS1               is a               bona fide               life-history trade-off gene that suppresses immediate reproduction and ensures survival by downregulating photosynthesis in limiting environments, as part of the general acclimation response to nutrient deprivation in photosynthetic organisms.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Parasites are arguably among the strongest drivers of natural selection, constraining hosts to evolve resistance and tolerance mechanisms. Although, the genetic basis of adaptation to parasite infection has been widely studied, little is known about how epigenetic changes contribute to parasite resistance and eventually, adaptation. Here, we investigated the role of host DNA methylation modifications to respond to parasite infections. In a controlled infection experiment, we used the three-spined stickleback fish, a model species for host--parasite studies, and their nematode parasite Camallanus lacustris. We showed that the levels of DNA methylation are higher in infected fish. Results furthermore suggest correlations between DNA methylation and shifts in key fitness and immune traits between infected and control fish, including respiratory burst and functional trans-generational traits such as the concentration of motile sperm. We revealed that genes associated with metabolic, developmental, and regulatory processes (cell death and apoptosis) were differentially methylated between infected and control fish. Interestingly, genes such as the neuropeptide FF receptor 2 and the integrin alpha 1 as well as molecular pathways including the Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation were hypermethylated in infected fish, suggesting parasite-mediated repression mechanisms of immune responses. Altogether, we demonstrate that parasite infection contributes to genome-wide DNA methylation modifications. Our study brings novel insights into the evolution of vertebrate immunity and suggests that epigenetic mechanisms are complementary to genetic responses against parasite-mediated selection.},

Although its importance has long been recognized in science, it has a history of neglect within policy, until now. The new Global Biodiversity Framework recently adopted by the Convention on Biological Diversity, states that genetic diversity must be maintained at levels assuring adaptive potential of populations, and includes metrics for systematic monitoring of genetic diversity in so called indicators. Similarly, indicators for genetic diversity are being developed at national levels. Here, we apply new indicators for Swedish national use to one of the northernmost salmonid fishes, the Arctic charr (               Salvelinus alpinus               ). We sequence whole genomes to monitor genetic diversity over four decades in three landlocked populations inhabiting protected alpine lakes in central Sweden. We find levels of genetic diversity, inbreeding and load to differ among lakes but remain stable over time. Effective population sizes are generally small ({$<$}\,500), suggesting a limited ability to maintain adaptive variability if genetic exchange with nearby populations became eliminated. We identify genomic regions potentially shaped by selection; SNPs exhibiting population divergence exceeding expectations under drift and a putative selective sweep acting within one lake to which the competitive brown trout (               Salmo trutta               ) was introduced during the sampling period. Identified genes appear involved in immunity and salinity tolerance. Present results suggest that genetically vulnerable populations of Arctic charr have maintained neutral and putatively adaptive genetic diversity despite small effective sizes, attesting the importance of continued protection and assurance of gene flow among populations.},

Coexisting salmonid fish populations are known from over 100 freshwater lakes. Most studies of sympatric populations have used limited numbers of genetic markers making it unclear if genetic divergence involves certain parts of the genome. We returned to the first reported case of salmonid sympatry, initially detected through contrasting homozygosity at a single allozyme locus (coding for lactate dehydrogenase A) in brown trout in the small Lakes Bunnersj{\"o}arna, Sweden. First, we verified the existence of the two coexisting demes using a 96-\-SNP fluidigm array. We then applied whole-\-genome resequencing of pooled DNA to explore genome-\-wide diversity within and between these demes; nucleotide diversity was higher in deme I than in deme II. Strong genetic divergence is observed with genome-\-wide FST {$\approx$} 0.2. Compared with data from populations of similar small lakes, this divergence is of similar magnitude as that between reproductively isolated populations. Individual whole-\-genome resequencing of two individuals per deme suggests higher inbreeding in deme II versus deme I, indicating different degree of isolation. We located two gene-\-copies for LDH-\-A and found divergence between demes in a regulatory section of one of these genes. However, we did not find a perfect fit between the sequence data and previous allozyme results, and this will require further research. Our data demonstrates genome-\-wide divergence governed mostly by genetic drift but also by diversifying selection in coexisting populations. This type of hidden biodiversity needs consideration in conservation management.},

While haplotypes under selection are rarely shared across urban populations, selective sweeps occur within the same genes, mostly linked to neural function and development. Collectively, we show that urban adaptation in a widespread songbird occurs through unique and shared selective sweeps in a core-set of behaviour-linked genes.},

However, evidence increasingly demonstrates that niche-constructing traits vary among genotypes within populations. Here, we consider the potential implications of genetic variation in niche construction for evolutionary genetics. Specifically, genetic variation in niche-constructing traits creates a correlation between genotype and environment. Because the environment influences which genes and genetic interactions underlie trait variation, genetic variation in niche construction can alter inferences about the heritability, pleiotropy and epistasis of traits that are phenotypically plastic. The effects of niche construction on these key evolutionary parameters further suggest novel ways by which niche construction can influence evolution.},

  abstract = {Animal coloration has traditionally been the target of genetic and evolutionary studies. However, until very recently, the study of the genetic basis of animal coloration has been mainly restricted to model species, whereas research on non-model species has been either neglected or mainly based on candidate approaches, and thereby limited by the knowledge obtained in model species. Recent high-throughput sequencing technologies allow us to overcome previous limitations, and open new avenues to study the genetic basis of animal coloration in a broader number of species and colour traits, and to address the general relevance of different genetic structures and their implications for the evolution of colour. In this review, we highlight aspects where genome-wide studies could be of major utility to fill in the gaps in our understanding of the biology and evolution of animal coloration. The new genomic approaches have been promptly adopted to study animal coloration although substantial work is still needed to consider a larger range of species and colour traits, such as those exhibiting continuous variation or based on reflective structures. We argue that a robust advancement in the study of animal coloration will also require large efforts to validate the functional role of the genes and variants discovered using genome-wide tools.

Since parasites harm their hosts, ecologists might expect negative relationships between infection and condition in wildlife, but this assumption is challenged by studies showing positive or null condition--infection relationships. Here, we outline common condition metrics used by ecologists in studies of parasitism, and consider mechanisms that cause negative, positive, and null condition--infection relationships in wildlife systems. We then perform a meta-analysis of 553 condition--infection relationships from 187 peer-reviewed studies of animal hosts, analysing observational and experimental records separately, and noting whether authors measured binary infection status or intensity. Our analysis finds substantial heterogeneity in the strength and direction of condition--infection relationships, a small, negative average effect size that is stronger in experimental studies, and evidence for publication bias towards negative relationships. The strongest predictors of variation in study outcomes are host thermoregulation and the methods used to evaluate body condition. We recommend that studies aiming to assess parasite impacts on body condition should consider host--parasite biology, choose condition measures that can change during the course of infection, and employ longitudinal surveys or manipulate infection status when feasible.},

After the introduction, Part II examines the emergence of ag-data codes of practice and provides two case studies---the American Farm Bureau's Privacy and Security Principles for Farm Data and New Zealand's Farm Data Code of Practice---that illustrate that the ultimate aims of ag-data codes of practice are inextricably linked to consent, disclosure, transparency and, ultimately, the building of trust. Part III highlights the commonalities and challenges of ag-data codes of practice. In Part IV several concluding observations are made. Most notably, while ag-data codes of practice may help change practices and convert complex details about ag-data contracts into something tangible, understandable and useable, it is important for agricultural industries to not hastily or uncritically accept or adopt ag-data codes of practice. There needs to be clear objectives, and a clear direction in which stakeholders want to take ag-data practices. In other words, stakeholders need to be sure about what they are trying, and able, to achieve with ag-data codes of practice. Ag-data codes of practice need credible administration, accreditation and monitoring. There also needs to be a way of reviewing and evaluating the codes in a more meaningful way than simple metrics such as the number of members: for example, we need to know something about whether the codes raise awareness and education around data practices, and, perhaps most importantly, whether they encourage changes in attitudes and behaviours around the access to and use of ag-data.},

Here, we analyse the genomic architecture of these heritable traits in a wild great tit (Parus major) population, using three marker-based approaches -- chromosome partitioning, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and a genome-wide association study (GWAS). The variance explained by each great tit chromosome scales with predicted chromosome size, no location in the genome contains genome-wide significant QTL, and no individual SNPs are associated with a large proportion of phenotypic variation, all of which may suggest that variation in both traits is due to many loci of small effect, located across the genome. There is no evidence that any regions of the genome contribute significantly to both traits, which combined with a small, nonsignificant negative genetic covariance between the traits, suggests the absence of genetic constraints on the independent evolution of these traits. Our findings support the hypothesis that variation in life history traits in natural populations is likely to be determined by many loci of small effect spread throughout the genome, which are subject to continued input of variation by mutation and migration, although we cannot exclude the possibility of an additional input of major effect genes influencing either trait.},

However, these opportunities are rarely distributed equally between women and men in science. Addressing gender inequity should be a primary consideration for all societies hosting conferences. Yet, many STEM conferences are struggling with gender biases and the understanding that gender inequity also applies to non-binary gender and overlapping social identities. At the Society for Conservation Biology's 4th International Marine Conservation Congress (IMCC4), ``Promoting the Participation of Women at Science Conferences'' was one of four focus groups of the Diversity Focus Group Series. This paper outlines 10 feasible intervention strategies delineated during the Women at Science Conferences focus group discussion as positive encouragement for professional societies to continue toward gender equity. The 10 interventions to reduce gender inequity at conferences include adopting community principles and a Code of Conduct, appointing a Safety Officer, requiring a registration honor system pledge and conduct surveys, offering a mentorship program, organizing focus groups, giving benefits for participating in diversity programming, assisting with child care, proffering travel grants, providing badges on lanyards, and randomizing the conference program. These strategies are intended to reduce participation barriers for women scientists at conferences, and range in the amount of planning they require to provide options for all societies regardless of their fiscal or labor capacity.},

To explore the genomic consequences of these processes, we assembled a high-quality mountain lion genome and analyzed a panel of resequenced individuals from across their geographic range. We found strong geographical structure and signatures of severe inbreeding in all North American populations. Tracts of homozygosity were rarely shared among populations, suggesting that assisted gene flow would restore local genetic diversity. However, the genome of an admixed Florida panther that descended from a translocated individual from Central America had surprisingly long tracts of homozygosity, indicating that genomic gains from translocation were quickly lost by local inbreeding. Thus, to sustain diversity, genetic rescue will need to occur at regular intervals, through repeated translocations or restoring landscape connectivity. Mountain lions provide a rare opportunity to examine the potential to restore diversity through genetic rescue, and to observe the long-term effects of translocation. Our methods and results provide a framework for genome-wide analyses that can be applied to the management of small and isolated populations.},

To explore the genomic consequences of this isolation, we assemble a draft puma genome and a geographically broad panel of resequenced individuals. We estimate that the lineage leading to present-day North American pumas diverged from South American lineages 300--100 thousand years ago. We find signatures of close inbreeding in geographically isolated North American populations, but also that tracts of homozygosity are rarely shared among these populations, suggesting that assisted gene flow would restore local genetic diversity. The genome of a Florida panther descended from translocated Central American individuals has long tracts of homozygosity despite recent outbreeding.

However, measurements from wearable electronics and other sources now allow us to analyze the dynamics of physiology and behavior with unsurpassed resolution. The resulting flood of data coincides with the emergence of novel analytical tools for estimating resilience from the pattern of microrecoveries observed in natural time series. Such dynamic indicators of resilience may be used to monitor the risk of systemic failure across systems ranging from organs to entire organisms. These tools invite a fundamental rethinking of our approach to the adaptive management of health and resilience.},

  abstract = {Imprints of racism                            Cities create challenging environments for many nonhuman species, and the presence of nonhumans in cities influences the health and well-being of the humans with which they share the environment. Distinct urban conditions are created by landscape modification, but the history of this transformation is not equal across urban environments. Schell               et al.               review how systematic racist practices such as residential segregation, enacted in part through redlining, have led to an unequal distribution of ``nature'' within cities. These inequities continue to play out in both the ecological processes of cities and the welfare of their residents.                                         Science               , this issue p.               eaay4497                        ,                             BACKGROUND               Human activity and decisions drive all life in cities. Worldwide, cities are characterized by extensive anthropogenic transformation of the landscape, modification of biogeochemical processes, and alteration of biological communities. Underlying all of these characteristics of urban ecosystems is an extraordinary variability in human agency, culture, power, and identity. Though our understanding of cities as ecological systems with distinctive community assemblages and landscape features has broadened considerably, researchers still rarely consider the full range of social drivers that affect landscape heterogeneity. One of the most characteristic attributes of cities is social inequality---specifically the uneven distribution of resources and wealth primarily underpinned by structural racism and classism. Because structural inequalities form the foundation of city infrastructure, urban development, governance, management, and landscape heterogeneity, inequality among humans defines the ecological setting and evolutionary trajectories for all urban organisms. More broadly, systematic inequities have profound impacts on global biological change and biodiversity loss. Many emergent social inequity patterns are principally driven by systemic racism and white supremacy. Hence, centering racial and economic justice in urban biological research and conservation is imperative. Here, we show how social inequalities shape ecological and evolutionary processes in U.S. cities and highlight the need for research that integrates justice perspectives with ecological and evolutionary dynamics.                                         ADVANCES               Although a rich literature demonstrates how historical and contemporary inequities emerge and persist in human systems, a transdisciplinary perspective that integrates social and cultural processes into an urban eco-evolutionary framework remains unexplored. In today's world, humans often shape the ecological conditions that drive patterns of species distribution and evolution. Distinctive urban landscape features---including reduced habitat patch size, novel plant communities, and increased distance among similar patches---affect key ecological processes such as population dynamics, species interactions, and food web structure. Recent research emphasizes that socioeconomic and demographic factors predict within-city variation in diverse environmental conditions. Humans directly control urban plant, animal, and microbe communities. Further, decisions about urban resource management are often dictated by a subset of individuals and institutions with social or economic capital. These decisions can bias the distribution of societal benefits derived from nature. Dominant social groups also enact and enforce policies and societal norms that exacerbate social and environmental inequities. Wealthier and predominantly white neighborhoods generally have more green space, more trees, and greater plant diversity than less affluent neighborhoods. In addition, synergies among pollution (e.g., light, noise, chemical), resource distribution, subsidized predators, and non-native species present novel challenges to organisms, which must respond by moving elsewhere, acclimatizing, adapting, or facing local extirpation. These stressors are often stratified according to racial and/or ethnic backgrounds and wealth. Further, intraspecific variation in phenotypic and genotypic traits of urban species may reflect human-induced disturbances. These relationships highlight the potential for both adaptive and neutral evolutionary processes in urban subpopulations to vary across neighborhoods within cities.                                         OUTLOOK               Stratification of wealth and property ownership shapes the distribution and management of urban spaces, thus constructing the urban ecosystem. Systemic racism and classism drive urban wealth stratification, emphasizing the need to address inequality-driven environmental heterogeneity in urban ecological and evolutionary studies. Residential segregation and colonial annexation (as well as gentrification and displacement) generate predictable ecological patterns in vegetation, air and water quality, microclimate, soils, and the built environment through the rapid influx of resources to specific areas. Accounting for such processes will allow more accurate estimation of the effect of humans on urban organisms. Deconstructing the complex and nuanced attributes of social inequality in affecting biological phenomena can also inform more equitable and sustainable urban planning solutions that implement anti-racist and justice-centered actions. Racial oppression and economic injustice are jeopardizing urban and global ecosystem health and function. Structural racism and classism are further layered with other inequalities, thus necessitating an intersectional approach to urban ecology. Deeper integration across the natural and social sciences is therefore an urgent priority for advancing our understanding of urban ecosystems and developing applied solutions that promote environmental justice, equity, and sustainability.                                                   Residential segregation and systemic racism have substantial impacts on ecological and evolutionary dynamics in cities.                   Government-sponsored policies stratify neighborhoods on the basis of race and class (e.g., through ``redlining'' in the United States, represented here by the red circle), which results in restricted access to social services and environmental amenities for racial and/or ethnic minorities and low-income communities (red arrows). Habitat quantity and quality tend to be greater in wealthier and predominantly white neighborhoods (green arrows), which leads to variations in ecological and evolutionary processes, underscoring the influence of systemic racism and inequality in driving urban landscape characteristics.                                                                         ,              Urban areas are dynamic ecological systems defined by interdependent biological, physical, and social components. The emergent structure and heterogeneity of urban landscapes drives biotic outcomes in these areas, and such spatial patterns are often attributed to the unequal stratification of wealth and power in human societies. Despite these patterns, few studies have effectively considered structural inequalities as drivers of ecological and evolutionary outcomes and have instead focused on indicator variables such as neighborhood wealth. In this analysis, we explicitly integrate ecology, evolution, and social processes to emphasize the relationships that bind social inequities---specifically racism---and biological change in urbanized landscapes. We draw on existing research to link racist practices, including residential segregation, to the heterogeneous patterns of flora and fauna observed by urban ecologists. In the future, urban ecology and evolution researchers must consider how systems of racial oppression affect the environmental factors that drive biological change in cities. Conceptual integration of the social and ecological sciences has amassed considerable scholarship in urban ecology over the past few decades, providing a solid foundation for incorporating environmental justice scholarship into urban ecological and evolutionary research. Such an undertaking is necessary to deconstruct urbanization's biophysical patterns and processes, inform equitable and anti-racist initiatives promoting justice in urban conservation, and strengthen community resilience to global environmental change.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in sequencing technologies have facilitated genomewide mapping of phenotypic variation in natural populations. Such mapping efforts face a number of challenges potentially leading to low reproducibility. However, reproducible research forms the basis of scientific progress. We here discuss the options for replication and the reasons for potential nonreproducibility. We then review the evidence for reproducible quantitative trait loci (QTL) with a focus on natural animal populations. Existing case studies of replication fall into three categories: (i) traits that have been mapped to major effect loci (including chromosomal inversion and supergenes) by independent research teams; (ii) QTL fine-mapped in discovery populations; and (iii) attempts to replicate QTL across multiple populations. Major effect loci, in particular those associated with inversions, have been successfully replicated in several cases within and across populations. Beyond such major effect variants, replication has been more successful within than across populations, suggesting that QTL discovered in natural populations may often be population-specific. This suggests that biological causes (differences in linkage patterns, allele frequencies or context-dependencies of QTL) contribute to nonreproducibility. Evidence from other fields, notably animal breeding and QTL mapping in humans, suggests that a significant fraction of QTL is indeed reproducible in direction and magnitude at least within populations. However, there is also a large number of QTL that cannot be easily reproduced. We put forward that more studies should explicitly address the causes and context-dependencies of QTL signals, in particular to disentangle linkage differences, allele frequency differences and gene-by-environment interactions as biological causes of nonreproducibility of QTL, especially between populations.},

Technological and statistical advances allow fine-scale study of animal decision-making, improving our understanding of possible causes and therefore conservation management. We quantified effects of reproductive preparation during spring migration on subsequent breeding outcomes, breeding outcomes on autumn migration characteristics and autumn migration characteristics on subsequent parental survival in Greenland white-fronted geese (               Anser albifrons flavirostris               ). These are long-distance migratory birds with an approximately 50\% population decline from 1999 to 2022. We deployed GPS-acceleration devices on adult females to quantify up to 5 years of individual decision-making throughout the annual cycle. Weather and habitat-use affected time spent feeding and overall dynamic body acceleration (i.e. energy expenditure) during spring and autumn. Geese that expended less energy and fed longer during spring were more likely to successfully reproduce. Geese with offspring expended more energy and fed for less time during autumn, potentially representing adverse fitness consequences of breeding. These behavioural comparisons among Greenland white-fronted geese improve our understanding of fitness trade-offs underlying abundance. We provide a reproducible framework for full annual cycle modelling using location and behaviour data, applicable to similarly studied migratory animals.},

In addition, pinpointing the genes driving ecological divergence is a key goal in molecular ecology. Here, larval transcriptome sequences obtained by next-generation-sequencing are used to address these issues in a morphologically cryptic sister species pair of non-biting midges (Chironomus riparius and C. piger). Results: More than eight thousand orthologous open reading frames were screened for interspecific divergence and intraspecific polymorphisms. Despite a small mean sequence divergence of 1.53\% between the sister species, 25.1\% of 18,115 observed amino acid substitutions were inferred by {$\alpha$} statistics to be driven by positive selection. Applying McDonald-Kreitman tests to 715 alignments of gene orthologues identified eleven (1.5\%) genes driven by positive selection. Conclusions: Three candidate genes were identified as potentially responsible for the observed niche segregation concerning nitrite concentration, habitat temperature and water conductivity. Additionally, signs of positive selection in the hydrogen sulfide detoxification pathway were detected, providing a new plausible hypothesis for the species' ecological differentiation. Finally, a divergently selected, nuclear encoded mitochondrial ribosomal protein may contribute to reproductive isolation due to cytonuclear coevolution.},

The three groups differed significantly in stepping during rectal palpation, which occurred less often in Neck- and Withers-animals than in control animals. Heart rate increase was significantly higher in the control group than in the two stroking groups. Previous stroking led to fewer stress reactions during the rectal palpation, possibly due to a combined effect of improved relationship towards and thus perception of humans and lasting anti-stress effects of tactile stimulation.

We screened methylation in populations from Kenya and Florida to determine if methylation varied among populations, varied with introduction history (Kenyan invasion {$<$}50 years old, Florida invasion {\textasciitilde}150 years old), and could potentially compensate for decrease genetic variation with introductions. While recent literature has speculated on the importance of epigenetic effects for biological invasions, this is the first such study among wild vertebrates. Methylation was more frequent in Nairobi, and outlier loci suggest that populations may be differentiated. Methylation diversity was similar between populations, in spite of known lower genetic diversity in Nairobi, which suggests that epigenetic variation may compensate for decreased genetic diversity as a source of phenotypic variation during introduction. Our results suggest that methylation differences may be common among house sparrows, but research is needed to discern whether methylation impacts phenotypic variation.},

Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion (CADD) is one of the first methods for the genome-wide prioritization of variants across different molecular functions and has been continuously developed and improved since its original publication. Here, we present our most recent release, CADD v1.7. We explored and integrated new annotation features, among them state-of-the-art protein language model scores (Meta ESM-1v), regulatory variant effect predictions (from sequence-based convolutional neural networks) and sequence conservation scores (Zoonomia). We evaluated the new version on data sets derived from ClinVar, ExAC/gnomAD and 1000 Genomes variants. For coding effects, we tested CADD on 31 Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) data sets from ProteinGym and, for regulatory effect prediction, we used saturation mutagenesis reporter assay data of promoter and enhancer sequences. The inclusion of new features further improved the overall performance of CADD. As with previous releases, all data sets, genome-wide CADD v1.7 scores, scripts for on-site scoring and an easy-to-use webserver are readily provided via https://cadd.bihealth.org/ or https://cadd.gs.washington.edu/ to the community.},

To understand such 'personality' variation, it is important to determine the mode of inheritance, but this has been quantified for only a few species. Here, we report results from a breeding experiment in captive zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, in which we cross-fostered offspring to disentangle the importance of genetic and non-genetic transmission of behaviour. Genetic and fosterparents' exploratory type was measured in a novel environment pre-breeding and offspring exploratory type was assessed at adulthood. Offspring exploratory type was predicted by the exploratory behaviour of the foster but not the genetic parents, whereas offspring sizewas predicted by genetic but not fosterparents' size. Other aspects of the social environment, such as rearing regime (uni- versus biparental), hatching position, brood size or an individual's sex did not influence offspring exploration. Our results therefore indicate that non-genetic transmission of behaviour can play an important role in shaping animal personality variation.},

Consequently, we examined olfactory communication in the ringtailed lemur, a socially complex primate that retains a functional vomeronasal organ, has well-developed scent glands and shows a suite of scent-marking behaviour. To assess the information content of different types of scent gland secretions, we decoupled olfactory cues from the visual and behavioural modalities with which scent marking is normally associated. We presented male and female subjects (signal receivers) with a series of choice tests between odours derived from conspecific donors (signal senders) varying by sex, age, social status and reproductive condition. We additionally examined the influence of the receivers' reproductive state and familiarity with the signaller. The reproductive condition, social status and familiarity of senders and receivers affected signal transmission; specifically, male receivers attended most to the odours of conspecifics in breeding condition and to the odours of familiar, dominant animals. By contrast, females varied their responses according to both their own reproductive state and that of the sender. Based on male and female patterns of countermarking, we suggest that scent marking serves a function in intergroup spacing and intrasexual competition for both sexes, as might be expected in a female-dominant species. By contrast, minimal female interest in male odours counters a female mate choice function for scent marking in this species. Nevertheless, scent marks are critical to male--male competition and, therefore, may be subject to sexual selection.},

  abstract = {In mammalian development, epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation patterns, play a crucial role in defining cell fate but also represent epigenetic barriers that restrict developmental potential. At two points in the life cycle, DNA methylation marks are reprogrammed on a global scale, concomitant with restoration of developmental potency. DNA methylation patterns are subsequently re-established with the commitment towards a distinct cell fate. This reprogramming of DNA methylation takes place firstly on fertilization in the zygote, and secondly in primordial germ cells (PGCs), which are the direct progenitors of sperm or oocyte. In each reprogramming window, a unique set of mechanisms regulates DNA methylation erasure and re-establishment. Recent advances have uncovered roles for the TET3 hydroxylase and passive demethylation, together with base excision repair (BER) and the elongator complex, in methylation erasure from the zygote. Deamination by AID, BER and passive demethylation have been implicated in reprogramming in PGCs, but the process in its entirety is still poorly understood. In this review, we discuss the dynamics of DNA methylation reprogramming in PGCs and the zygote, the mechanisms involved and the biological significance of these events. Advances in our understanding of such natural epigenetic reprogramming are beginning to aid enhancement of experimental reprogramming in which the role of potential mechanisms can be investigated in vitro . Conversely, insights into in vitro reprogramming techniques may aid our understanding of epigenetic reprogramming in the germline and supply important clues in reprogramming for therapies in regenerative medicine.},

Epigenetic research on birds in their natural habitats is still in its infancy, but is needed to answer questions regarding the origin of epigenetic marks and their role in phenotypic variation and evolution. Here we review the potential for studying epigenetic variation in natural bird systems. We aim to provide insights into (1) the origin of epigenetic variation, (2) the relationship between epigenetic variation and trait variation, and (3) the possible role of epigenetic variation in adaptation to changing environments. As there is currently little research on epigenetics in wild birds, we examine how findings on other taxa such as plants and mammals relate to birds. We also examine some of the pros and cons of the most commonly used methods to study patterns of DNA methylation in birds, and suggest some topics we believe need to be addressed to develop the field of wild avian epigenetics further.},

  abstract = {Early developmental conditions are known to have life-long effects on an individual's behavior, physiology and fitness. In altricial birds, a majority of these conditions, such as the number of siblings and the amount of food provisioned, are controlled by the parents. This opens up the potential for parents to adjust the behavior and physiology of their offspring according to local post-natal circumstances. However, the mechanisms underlying such intergenerational regulation remain largely unknown. A mechanism often proposed to possibly explain how parental effects mediate consistent phenotypic change is DNA methylation. To investigate whether early life effects on offspring phenotypes are mediated by DNA methylation, we cross-fostered great tit ( Parus major ) nestlings and manipulated their brood size in a natural study population. We assessed genome-wide DNA methylation levels of CpG sites in erythrocyte DNA, using Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS). By comparing DNA methylation levels between biological siblings raised in enlarged and reduced broods and between biological siblings of control broods, we assessed which CpG sites were differentially methylated due to brood size. We found 32 differentially methylated sites (DMS) between siblings from enlarged and reduced broods, a larger number than in the comparison between siblings from control broods. A considerable number of these DMS were located in or near genes involved in development, growth, metabolism, behavior and cognition. Since the biological functions of these genes line up with previously found effects of brood size and food availability, it is likely that the nestlings in the enlarged broods suffered from nutritional stress. We therefore conclude that early life stress might directly affect epigenetic regulation of genes related to early life conditions. Future studies should link such experimentally induced DNA methylation changes to expression of phenotypic traits and assess whether these effects affect parental fitness to determine if such changes are also adaptive.},

Epigenetic modifications and DNA methylation in particular provide organisms with a mechanism to shape their phenotypic responses during development. Studies suggest that environmentally induced DNA methylation might allow for adaptive phenotypic plasticity that could last throughout an organism's lifetime. Despite a number of studies demonstrating environmentally induced DNA methylation changes, we know relatively little about what proportion of the epigenome is affected by environmental factors, rather than being a consequence of genetic variation. In the current study, we use a partial cross-foster design in a natural great tit (Parus major) population to disentangle the effects of common origin from common rearing environment on DNA methylation. We found that variance in DNA methylation in 8,315 CpG sites was explained by a common origin and only in 101 by a common rearing environment. Subsequently, we mapped quantitative trait loci for the brood of origin CpG sites and detected 754 cis and 4,202 trans methylation quantitative trait loci, involving 24\% of the CpG sites. Our results indicate that the scope for environmentally induced methylation marks independent of the genotype is limited and that the majority of variation in DNA methylation early in life is determined by genetic factors instead. These findings suggest that there may be little opportunity for selection to act on variation in DNA methylation. This implies that most DNA methylation variation likely does not evolve independently of genomic changes.},

Empirical work has shown that for a SNP chip developed in a bovid and applied to a cervid species, approximately 50\% genotype success with 1\% of the loci being polymorphic is expected (Miller et al. 2012). The genotyping of Kharzinova et al. (2015) follows this pattern; however, these data are not appropriate for identifying runs of homozygosity (ROH) and can be problematic for estimating linkage disequilibrium (LD) and we caution readers in this regard.},

By characterizing small RNA dynamics during germ cell maturation in mice, we confirm and extend prior observations that sperm undergo a dramatic switch in the RNA payload from piRNAs to tRNA fragments (tRFs) upon exiting the testis and entering the epididymis. Small RNA delivery to sperm could be recapitulated in vitro by incubating testicular spermatozoa with caput epididymosomes. Finally, tissue-specific metabolic labeling of RNAs in intact mice definitively shows that mature sperm carry RNAs that were originally synthesized in the epididymal epithelium. These data demonstrate that soma-germline RNA transfer occurs in male mammals, most likely via vesicular transport from the epididymis to maturing sperm.},

Brood size affects a variety of life-history and fitness-related traits, but relatively little is known about the mechanisms that might mediate these effects. There is accumulating evidence that early-life environments can influence adult phenotypes though epigenetic mechanisms such as variation in DNA methylation. Here, we profile DNA methylation in nestling Zebra Finches (Taeniopygia guttata) raised in naturally variable and experimentally manipulated brood sizes. We found that (1) natal brood size is significantly, positively correlated with percent DNA methylation in blood; and (2) individuals in manipulated broods experience significantly more demethylation events across early development than individuals from broods that remain the same size. Any manipulation of brood size creates fluctuations in early developmental conditions, potentially explaining why the frequency of demethylation events in these treatments was higher than in control broods. We also found that the specific loci that lost and gained methylation across early development differed between individuals in enlarged and reduced broods, which may reflect the different developmental pressures imposed by the different manipulations. Although the phenotypic consequences of reduced levels of methylation are yet to be elucidated, our findings support the hypothesis that brood size is associated with the prevalence and pattern of DNA methylation in wild birds.},

We detected an increase in genome-wide levels of DNA methylation between day 3 and day 11 of post hatch development in wild zebra finches. In the wild, ambient temperatures were also found to affect genome-wide levels of DNA methylation and plasticity in the methylation state of individual loci. Family effects had a significant influence on DNA methylation throughout our study, and while we did not detect an effect of temperature on DNA methylation levels in non-related captive birds, our sibling pair analyses revealed that within families, elevated temperatures were associated with higher levels of DNA methylation.

  abstract = {Speaking engagements, serving as session chairs, and receiving awards at national meetings are essential stepping stones towards professional success for scientific researchers. Studies of gender parity in meetings of national scientific societies repeatedly uncover bias in speaker selection, engendering underrepresentation of women among featured presenters. To continue this dialogue, we analyzed membership data and annual conference programs of a large scientific society ({$>$}7000 members annually) in a male-rich ({\textasciitilde}70\% males), technology-oriented STEM subfield. We detected a pronounced skew towards males among invited keynote lecturers, plenary speakers, and recipients of the society's Senior Investigator award (15\%, 13\%, and 8\% females, respectively). However, the proportion of females among Mid-Career and Young Investigator award recipients and oral session chairs resembled the current gender distribution of the general membership. Female members were more likely to present at the conferences and equally likely to apply and be accepted for oral presentations as their male counterparts. The gender of a session chair had no effect on the gender distribution of selected applicants. Interestingly, we identified several research subareas that were naturally enriched (i.e., not influenced by unequal selection of presenters) for either female or male participants, illustrating within a single subfield the gender divide along biology-technology line typical of all STEM disciplines. Two female-enriched topics experienced a rapid growth in popularity within the examined period, more than doubling the number of associated researchers. Collectively, these findings contribute to the contemporary discourse on gender in science and hopefully will propel positive changes within this and other societies.},

To understand the biology of these genomes, annotation of gene features and other functional elements is essential; however, for most species, only the reference genome is well-annotated.                                         Results               One strategy to annotate new or improved genome assemblies is to map or `lift over' the genes from a previously annotated reference genome. Here, we describe Liftoff, a new genome annotation lift-over tool capable of mapping genes between two assemblies of the same or closely related species. Liftoff aligns genes from a reference genome to a target genome and finds the mapping that maximizes sequence identity while preserving the structure of each exon, transcript and gene. We show that Liftoff can accurately map 99.9\% of genes between two versions of the human reference genome with an average sequence identity \&gt;99.9\%. We also show that Liftoff can map genes across species by successfully lifting over 98.3\% of human protein-coding genes to a chimpanzee genome assembly with 98.2\% sequence identity.                                         Availability and implementation               Liftoff can be installed via bioconda and PyPI.

We present how the color spectra data can be comprehensively used for studying the importance of sexual ornaments in the black grouse and how these ornaments are related to a male condition. For this, we used both correlative field and experimental data. Field data indicated that older males had more chromatic coloration than yearlings. Blue chroma of males was correlated with male mating success. We experimentally manipulated yearling birds with testosterone implants and found that testosterone-implanted males had impaired expression of several sexual ornaments: 10 months after the implantation, both structuralbased blue and carotenoid-based red eye comb coloration were diminished, as well as lyre (tail) length. However, the manipulation did not affect vital traits under natural selection (wing length or body mass). Our data indicate that structural color is an important trait in sexual selection in this lekking species. Importantly, the data also indicate that male sexual ornaments are more susceptible to environmental conditions than the other male traits, thus showing their heightened condition dependency compared with the other traits mediating the honesty of signaling.},

The responsiveness and sensitivity of an offspring's stress response may be shaped not only by stressors encountered in their early post-natal environment but also by stressors in their parent's environment. Yet, few studies have considered how stressors encountered in both of these early life environments may function together to impact the developing HPA axis. Here, we manipulated stressors in the parental and post-natal environments in a population of house sparrows (Passer domesticus) to assess their impact on changes in DNA methylation (and corresponding gene expression) in a suite of genes within the HPA axis. We found that nestlings that experienced early life stress across both life-history periods had higher DNA methylation in a critical HPA axis gene, the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1). In addition, we found that the life-history stage when stress was encountered impacted some genes (HSD11B1, NR3C1 and NR3C2) differently. We also found evidence for the mitigation of parental stress by post-natal stress (in HSD11B1 and NR3C2). Finally, by assessing DNA methylation in both the brain and blood, we were able to evaluate cross-tissue patterns. While some differentially methylated regions were tissue-specific, we found cross-tissue changes in NR3C2 and NR3C1, suggesting that blood is a suitable tissue for assessing DNA methylation as a biomarker of early life stress. Our results provide a crucial first step in understanding the mechanisms by which early life stress in different life-history periods contributes to changes in the epigenome of the HPA axis.},

  abstract = {The prevailing theory for the molecular basis of evolution involves genetic mutations that ultimately generate the heritable phenotypic variation on which natural selection acts. However, epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of phenotypic variation may also play an important role in evolutionary change. A growing number of studies have demonstrated the presence of epigenetic inheritance in a variety of different organisms that can persist for hundreds of generations. The possibility that epigenetic changes can accumulate over longer periods of evolutionary time has seldom been tested empirically. This study was designed to compare epigenetic changes among several closely related species of Darwin's finches, a well-known example of adaptive radiation. Erythrocyte DNA was obtained from five species of sympatric Darwin's finches that vary in phylogenetic relatedness. Genome-wide alterations in genetic mutations using copy number variation (CNV) were compared with epigenetic alterations associated with differential DNA methylation regions (epimutations). Epimutations were more common than genetic CNV mutations among the five species; furthermore, the number of epimutations increased monotonically with phylogenetic distance. Interestingly, the number of genetic CNV mutations did not consistently increase with phylogenetic distance. The number, chromosomal locations, regional clustering, and lack of overlap of epimutations and genetic mutations suggest that epigenetic changes are distinct and that they correlate with the evolutionary history of Darwin's finches. The potential functional significance of the epimutations was explored by comparing their locations on the genome to the location of evolutionarily important genes and cellular pathways in birds. Specific epimutations were associated with genes related to the bone morphogenic protein, toll receptor, and melanogenesis signaling pathways. Speciesspecific epimutations were significantly overrepresented in these pathways. As environmental factors are known to result in heritable changes in the epigenome, it is possible that epigenetic changes contribute to the molecular basis of the evolution of Darwin's finches. Key words: epimutations, DNA methylation, copy number variation, phylogeny, adaptive radiation, BMP, toll, melanogenesis.},

Environmental factors that influence early life critical windows of development generally do not have the capacity to modify genome sequence, nor promote permanent genetic modifications. Epigenetics provides a molecular mechanism for environment to influence development, program cellular differentiation, and alter the genetic regulation of development. The current review discusses how epigenetics can cooperate with genetics to regulate development and allow for greater plasticity in response to environmental influences. This impacts area such as cellular differentiation, tissue development, environmental induced disease etiology, epigenetic transgenerational inheritance, and the general systems biology of organisms and evolution.},

Mice in the hybrid zone are highly admixed, representing the full range of mixed ancestry from the two subspecies. Given the distinct morphologies of these subspecies, these natural hybrids can be used for genomewide association mapping at sufficiently high resolution to directly infer candidate genes. We focus here on limb bone length differences, which is of special interest for understanding the evolution of developmentally correlated traits. We used 172 first-generation descendants of wild-caught mice from the hybrid zone to measure the length of stylopod (humerus/femur), zeugopod (ulna/tibia) and autopod (metacarpal/metatarsal) elements in skeletal CT scans. We find phenotypic covariation between limb elements in the hybrids similar to patterns previously described in Mus musculus domesticus inbred strains, suggesting that the hybrid genotypes do not influence the covariation pattern in a major way. Mapping was performed using 143,592 SNPs and identified several genomic regions associated with length differences in each bone. Bone length was found to be highly polygenic. None of the candidate regions include the canonical genes known to control embryonic limb development. Instead, we are able to identify candidate genes with known roles in osteoblast differentiation and bone structure determination, as well as recently evolved genes of, as yet, unknown function.},

If not removed by purifying selection, such deleterious mutations will generate a genetic load that can have negative fitness effects in small populations and increase the risk of extinction. This is relevant for the highly inbred Scandinavian wolf (               Canis lupus               ) population, founded by only three wolves in the 1980s and suffering from inbreeding depression. We used functional annotation and evolutionary conservation scores to study deleterious variation in a total of 209 genomes from both the Scandinavian and neighbouring wolf populations in northern Europe. The masked load (deleterious mutations in heterozygote state) was highest in Russia and Finland with deleterious alleles segregating at lower frequency than neutral variation. Genetic drift in the Scandinavian population led to the loss of ancestral alleles, fixation of deleterious variants and a significant increase in the per-individual realized load (deleterious mutations in homozygote state; an increase by 45\% in protein-coding genes) over five generations of inbreeding. Arrival of immigrants gave a temporary genetic rescue effect with ancestral alleles re-entering the population and thereby shifting deleterious alleles from homozygous into heterozygote genotypes. However, in the absence of permanent connectivity to Finnish and Russian populations, inbreeding has then again led to the exposure of deleterious mutations. These observations provide genome-wide insight into the magnitude of genetic load and genetic rescue at the molecular level, and in relation to population history. They emphasize the importance of securing gene flow in the management of endangered populations.},

The intergenerational transfer of wealth privileges some individuals over others through the transmission of resources external to an individual organism. Privileged access to household wealth (e.g., land, shelter, silver) positively influences the destinies of some (and their descendants) over others in human societies. Strikingly parallel phenomena exist in animal societies. Inheritance of nongenetic commodities (e.g., a nest, territory, tool) external to an individual also contributes greatly to direct fitness in animals. Here, we illustrate the evolutionary diversity of privilege and its disparity-generating effects on the evolutionary trajectories of lineages across the Tree of Life. We propose that integration of approaches used to study these patterns in humans may offer new insights into a core principle from behavioral ecology---differential access to inherited resources---and help to establish a broad, comparative framework for studying inequality in animals.},

The maximum values of commonly used parameters such as r2 and D vary depending on the allele frequencies at each locus. However, though this phenomenon is recognized and accounted for in many studies, the comprehensive mathematical framework underlying the limits of linkage disequilibrium measures at various frequency combinations is often heuristic or empirical. Here, it is demonstrated that underlying this behavior is the fundamental shift between linear and nonlinear dependence in the linkage disequilibrium structure between loci. The proportion of linear and nonlinear dependence can be estimated and it demonstrates how even the same values of r2 can have different implications for the nature of the overall dependence. One result of this is the value of D{$\prime$}, when defined as only a positive number, has a minimum value of {\textbar}r{\textbar}. Understanding this dependence is crucial to making correct inferences about the relationships between two loci in linkage disequilibrium.},

Plant defenses are known to be primed or directly induced by herbivore damage within generations and across generations by long-lasting epigenetic mechanisms. However, little is known about the differences between life stages of epigenetically inducible defensive traits across generations. To help fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a multigenerational experiment to determine whether defense induction in wild radish plants was reflected in chromatin modifications (DNA methylation); we then examined differences between seedlings and reproductive plants in current and transgenerational plasticity in chemical (glucosinolates) and physical (trichomes) defenses in this species. Herbivory triggered genome methylation both in targeted plants and their offspring. Within one generation, both defenses were highly inducible at the seedling stage, but only chemical defenses were inducible in reproductive plants. Across generations, herbivory experienced by mother plants caused strong direct induction of physical defenses in their progeny, with effects lasting from seedling to reproductive stages. For chemical defenses, however, this transgenerational induction was evident only in adults. Transgenerational priming was observed in physical and chemical defenses, particularly in adult plants. Our results show that transgenerational plasticity in plant defenses in response to herbivore offense differs for physical and chemical defense and changes across plant life stages.},

The purpose of our paper was to synthesise current knowledge of autumn and winter hunting disturbance on migratory birds and to describe a case study in Hellas (Greece). Hunting may influence migratory bird behaviour and movements, but studies have not found a corresponding increase in non-hunting mortality factors or any reduction in feeding, body condition, breeding success and any long-term population decrease. We developed a diagnostic procedure which provides a tool for assessing the potential susceptibility of a species or group of species to hunting disturbance. The application of this procedure showed that the influence of hunting disturbance on quarry species is inverse to hunting harvest. This new insight should be considered in a holistic hunting management approach.},

In males the harvest mortality increased with age, whereas in females the pattern was U-shaped with higher harvest mortality of less fecund young (1-3 year) and old (a 10 years) age classes, and lower harvest mortality of prime age (4-9 years old) females. In both sexes, the calf harvest mortality was low, although it in\- creased with increasing calf quotas following a change from an indiscrimi\- nate to a sex- and age-specific hunting system during the study period. In adult males, the mortality pattern was opposite of what was expected based on the previously reported higher susceptibility to hunting of young than old males, indicating that hunter selectivity for large (old) males affected the pattern. Moreover, the selectivity of the hunters decreased as the hunting pressure increased, suggesting that the hunters became less selective when the mean time available per moose in the quota decreased. Among adult female age groups, the variation in harvest mortality increased with the proportion of calves per female in the population prior to hunting. This was mainly because of relatively higher mortality of post-prime females, supporting our expectation that hunters avoid shooting females with calves and thus in\- crease the harvest of less fecund age groups during high recruitment years. The observed selectivity led to harvest mortality that differed significantly from patterns of natural mortality, even where the mortality is mainly due to wolves Canis lupus and bears Ursus arctos. This may have consequences for the life history evolution of both male and female moose. The potential ecological, evolutionary and management implications of the results are dis\- cussed.},

  abstract = {The question as to how early life experiences are stored on a molecular level and affect traits later in life is highly topical in ecology, medicine, and epigenetics. In this study, we use a fish model to investigate whether DNA methylation mediates early life experiences and predetermines a territorial male reproductive phenotype. In fish, adult reproductive phenotypes frequently depend on previous life experiences and are often associated with distinct morphological traits. DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism which is both sensitive to environmental conditions and stably inherited across cell divisions. We therefore investigate early life predisposition in the round goby Neogobius melanostomus by growth back-calculations and then study DNA methylation by MBD-Seq in the brain region controlling vertebrate reproductive behavior, the hypothalamus. We find a link between the territorial reproductive phenotype and high growth rates in the first year of life. However, hypothalamic DNA methylation patterns reflect the current behavioral status independently of early life experiences. Together, our data suggest a non-predetermination scenario in the round goby, in which indeterminate males progress to a non-territorial status in the spawning season, and in which some males then assume a specialized territorial phenotype if current conditions are favorable.},

  abstract = {Background{\enspace} Miniature pigs have been increasingly used as mammalian model animals for biomedical research because of their similarity to human beings in terms of their metabolic features and proportional organ sizes. However, despite their importance, there is a severe lack of genome-wide studies on miniature pigs. Objective{\enspace} In this study, we performed whole-genome sequencing analysis of 20 Micro-pigs obtained from Medi Kinetics to elucidate their genomic characteristics. Results{\enspace} Approximately 595 gigabase pairs (Gb) of sequence reads were generated to be mapped to the swine reference genome assembly (Sus scrofa 10.2); on average, the sequence reads covered 99.15\% of the reference genome at an average of 9.6-fold coverage. We detected a total of 19,518,548 SNPs, of which 8.7\% were found to be novel. With further annotation of all of the SNPs, we retrieved 144,507 nonsynonymous SNPs (nsSNPs); of these, 5968 were found in all 20 individuals used in this study. SIFT prediction for these SNPs identified that 812 nsSNPs in 402 genes were deleterious. Among these 402 genes, we identified some genes that could potentially affect traits of interest in Micro-pigs, such as RHEB and FRAS1. Furthermore, we performed runs of homozygosity analysis to locate potential selection signatures in the genome, detecting several loci that might be involved in phenotypic characteristics in Micro-pigs, such as MSTN, GDF5, and GDF11. Conclusion{\enspace} In this study, we identified numerous nsSNPs that could be used as candidate genetic markers with involvement in traits of interest. Furthermore, we detected putative selection footprints that might be associated with recent selection applied to miniature pigs.},

  abstract = {Secondary sexual trait expression can be influenced by fixed individual factors (such as genetic quality) as well as by dynamic factors (such as age and environmentally induced gene expression) that may be associated with variation in condition or quality. In particular, melanin-\-based traits are known to relate to condition and there is a well-\-characterized genetic pathway underpinning their expression. However, the mechanisms linking variable trait expression to genetic quality remain unclear. One plausible mechanism is that genetic quality could influence trait expression via differential methylation and differential gene expression. We therefore conducted a pilot study examining DNA methylation at a candidate gene (agouti-\-related neuropeptide: AgRP) in the black grouse Lyrurus tetrix. We specifically tested whether CpG methylation covaries with age and multilocus heterozygosity (a proxy of genetic quality) and from there whether the expression of a melanin-\-based ornament (ultraviolet-\-blue chroma) correlates with DNA methylation. Consistent with expectations, we found clear evidence for age-\-  and heterozygosity-\-specific patterns of DNA methylation, with two CpG sites showing the greatest DNA methylation in highly heterozygous males at their peak age of reproduction. Furthermore, DNA methylation at three CpG sites was significantly positively correlated with ultraviolet-\-blue chroma. Ours is the first study to our knowledge to document age-\- and quality-\-dependent variation in DNA methylation and to show that dynamic sexual trait expression across the lifespan of an organism is associated with patterns of DNA methylation. Although we cannot demonstrate causality, our work provides empirical support for a mechanism that could potentially link key individual factors to variation in sexual trait expression in a wild vertebrate.},

They have a fundamental role to deliver oxygen to tissues, and their ability to do so is shaped by the tissue's need and their shape. Despite considerable interest in how other components of blood are shaped by ecology and life history, few studies have considered erythrocytes themselves. We tested how erythrocyte size and shape varied in relation to energetically demanding activities using a dataset of 631 bird species. We found that in general, birds undergoing greater activities such as long distance migration had smaller and more elongated cells, while those with greater male-male competition had smaller and rounder cells. Smaller, more elongated erythrocytes allow more rapid oxygenation/deoxygenation and support greater aerobic activity. The rounder erythrocytes found in species with strong male--male competition may stem from younger erythrocytes deriving from androgen-induced erythropoiesis rates. Finally, diving species of bird had larger erythrocytes, indicating that erythrocytes are acting as a vital oxygen store. In summary, erythrocyte size and shape in birds are driven by the need to deliver oxygen during energetically costly activities.},

  abstract = {Illnesses caused by a variety of micro- and macro- organisms can negatively affect individuals' fitness, leading to the expectation that immunity is under positive selection. However, immune responses are costly and individuals must tradeoff their immune response with other fitness components (e.g. survival or reproductive success) meaning that individuals with intermediate response may have the greatest overall fitness. Such a process might be particularly acute in species with strong sexual selection because the condition-dependence of male secondary sexual-traits might lead to striking phenotypic differences amongst males of different immune response levels. We tested whether there is selection on immune response by survival and reproduction in yearling and adult male black grouse (Lyrurus tetrix) following an immune challenge with a novel antigen and tested the hypothesis that sexual signals and body mass are honest signals of the immune response. We show that yearling males with highest immune response to these challenges had higher survival, but the reverse was true for adults. Adults with higher responses had highest mass loss and adult males with intermediate immune response had highest mating success. Tail length was related to baseline response in adults and more weakly in yearlings. Our findings reveal the complex fitness consequences of mounting an immune response across age classes. Such major differences in the direction and magnitude of selection in multiple fitness components is an alternative route underpinning the stabilising selection of immune responses with an intermediate immune response being optimal.},

  abstract = {Chimpanzees have consistent individual differences in behaviour, also referred to as personality. Similar to human personality structure, five dimensions are commonly found in chimpanzee studies that show evidence for convergent and predictive validity (Dominance, Openness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Reactivity/Undependability). These dimensions are to some extent heritable, indicating a genetic component that explains part of the variation in personality scores, but are also influenced by environmental factors, such as the early social rearing background of the individuals. In this study, we investigated the role of epigenetic modification of the dopamine receptor D2 gene (DRD2) as a potential mechanism underlying personality variation in 51 captive chimpanzees. We used previously collected personality trait rating data and determined levels of DRD2 CpG methylation in peripheral blood samples for these same individuals. Results showed that DRD2 methylation is most strongly associated with Extraversion, and that varying methylation levels at specific DRD2 sites are associated with changes in Extraversion in nursery-reared, but not mother-reared, individuals. These results highlight the role of dopaminergic signalling in chimpanzee personality, and indicate that environmental factors, such as social experiences early in life, can have long-lasting behavioural effects, potentially through modification of the epigenome. These findings add to the growing evidence demonstrating the importance of the experience-dependent methylome for the development of complex social traits like personality.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Motivation: Computational annotation of protein coding genes in genomic DNA is a widely used and essential tool for analyzing newly sequenced genomes. However, current methods suffer from inaccuracy and do poorly with certain types of genes. Including additional sources of evidence of the existence and structure of genes can improve the quality of gene predictions. For many eukaryotic genomes, expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are available as evidence for genes. Related genomes that have been sequenced, annotated, and aligned to the target genome provide evidence of existence and structure of genes.             Results: We incorporate several different evidence sources into the gene finder AUGUSTUS. The sources of evidence are gene and transcript annotations from related species syntenically mapped to the target genome using TransMap, evolutionary conservation of DNA, mRNA and ESTs of the target species, and retroposed genes. The predictions include alternative splice variants where evidence supports it. Using only ESTs we were able to correctly predict at least one splice form exactly correct in 57\% of human genes. Also using evidence from other species and human mRNAs, this number rises to 77\%. Syntenic mapping is well-suited to annotate genomes closely related to genomes that are already annotated or for which extensive transcript evidence is available. Native cDNA evidence is most helpful when the alignments are used as compound information rather than independent positionwise information.             Availability: AUGUSTUS is open source and available at http://augustus.gobics.de. The gene predictions for human can be browsed and downloaded at the UCSC Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu)             Contact: ~mstanke@gwdg.de             Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Here, we describe a genome-wide analysis of LD in the zebra finch (               Taeniopygia guttata               ) using 838 single nucleotide polymorphisms and present LD maps for all assembled chromosomes. We found that LD declined with physical distance approximately five times faster on the microchromosomes compared to macrochromosomes. The distribution of LD across individual macrochromosomes also varied in a distinct pattern. In the center of the macrochromosomes there were large blocks of markers, sometimes spanning tens of mega bases, in strong LD whereas on the ends of macrochromosomes LD declined more rapidly. Regions of high LD were not simply the result of suppressed recombination around the centromere and this pattern has not been observed previously in other taxa. We also found evidence that this pattern of LD has remained stable across many generations. The variability in LD between and within chromosomes has important implications for genome wide association studies in birds and for our understanding of the distribution of recombination events and the processes that govern them.},

Study 2 investigated what parent-academia stereotypes predict in terms of endorsements for hiring men versus women in a mock hiring task set in an academic context. Academics (N = 112) evaluated mock job candidates for an Assistant Professor post while the gender, parental status and leave status of the candidates were manipulated. The findings showed that parents were significantly less likely to be endorsed to be hired than non-parents, regardless of gender. Parent-academia stereotypes led to biased hiring recommendations, such that a greater endorsement of parent-academia stereotypes predicted a reduced likelihood to endorse hiring parents compared to non-parents. Implications for reducing parent stereotypes in academic contexts are discussed.},

  abstract = {Mechanisms and processes of ecologically driven adaptive speciation are best studied in natural situations where the splitting process is still occurring, i.e. before complete reproductive isolation is achieved. Here, we present a case of an early stage of adaptive differentiation under sympatric conditions in the fire salamander, Salamandra salamandra, that allows inferring the underlying processes for the split. Larvae of S. salamandra normally mature in small streams until metamorphosis, but in an old, continuous forest area near Bonn (the Kottenforst), we found salamander larvae not only in small streams but also in shallow ponds, which are ecologically very different from small streams. Common-environment experiments with larvae from both habitat types reveal specific adaptations to these different ecological conditions. Mitochondrial and microsatellite analyses show that the two ecologically differentiated groups also show signs of genetic differentiation. A parallel analysis of animals from a neighbouring much larger forest area (the Eifel), in which larvae mature only in streams, shows no signs of genetic differentiation, indicating that gene flow between ecologically similar types can occur over large distances. Hence, geographical factors cannot explain the differential larval habitat adaptations in the Kottenforst, in particular since adult life and mating of S. salamandra is strictly terrestrial and not associated with larval habitats. We propose therefore that the evolution of these adaptations was coupled with the evolution of cues for assortative mating which would be in line with models of sympatric speciation that suggest a co-evolution of habitat adaptations and associated mating signals.},

Here, we use transcriptomic and genomic data from the butterfly               Bicyclus anynana               , a model system for seasonal plasticity, to compare the extent of differential expression and splicing and test how these axes of transcriptional plasticity differ in their potential for evolutionary change. Between seasonal morphs, we find that differential splicing affects a smaller but functionally unique set of genes compared to differential expression. Further, we find strong support for the novel hypothesis that spliced genes are more susceptible than differentially expressed genes to erosion of genetic variation due to selection on seasonal plasticity. Our results suggest that splicing plasticity is especially likely to experience genetic constraints that could affect the potential of wild populations to respond to rapidly changing environments.},

Inbreeding manifests in long runs of homozygosity (ROH), which make up nearly half of the genome in the most inbred individuals. The ROH landscape varies widely across the genome, with islands where up to 87\% and deserts where only 4\% of individuals have ROH. The fitness consequences of inbreeding are severe; a 10\% increase in individual inbreeding               F               ROH               is associated with a 60\% reduction in the odds of survival in lambs, though inbreeding depression decreases with age.

Populations with higher genetic diversity are more likely to contain individuals that are better adapted to new circumstances than populations with lower genetic diversity. Here, we use both neutral and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) markers to test whether small and highly fragmented populations hold lower genetic diversity than large ones. We use black grouse as it is distributed across Europe and found in populations with varying degrees of isolation and size. We sampled 11 different populations; five continuous, three isolated, and three small and isolated. We tested patterns of genetic variation in these populations using three different types of genetic markers: nine microsatellites and 21 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which both were found to be neutral, and two functional MHC genes that are presumably under selection. The small isolated populations displayed significantly lower neutral genetic diversity compared to continuous populations. A similar trend, but not as pronounced, was found for genotypes at MHC class II loci. Populations were less divergent at MHC genes compared to neutral markers. Measures of genetic diversity and population genetic structure were positively correlated among microsatellites and SNPs, but none of them were correlated to MHC when comparing all populations. Our results suggest that balancing selection at MHC loci does not counteract the power of genetic drift when populations get small and fragmented.},

Here, we investigated naturally-occurring variation in DNA methylation in a wild avian species, the white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis). This species offers exceptional opportunities for studying the link between genetic differentiation and phenotypic traits because of a nonrecombining chromosome pair linked to both plumage and behavioural phenotypes. Using novel single-nucleotide resolution methylation maps and gene expression data, we show that DNA methylation and the expression of DNA methyltransferases are significantly higher in adults than in nestlings. Genes for which DNA methylation varied between nestlings and adults were implicated in development and cell differentiation and were located throughout the genome. In contrast, differential methylation between plumage morphs was concentrated in the nonrecombining chromosome pair. Interestingly, a large number of CpGs on the nonrecombining chromosome, localized to transposable elements, have undergone dramatic loss of DNA methylation since the split of the ZAL2 and ZAL2m chromosomes. Changes in methylation predicted changes in gene expression for both chromosomes. In summary, we demonstrate changes in genome-wide DNA methylation that are associated with development and with specific functional categories of genes in white-throated sparrows. Moreover, we observe substantial DNA methylation reprogramming associated with the suppression of recombination, with implications for genome integrity and gene expression divergence. These results offer an unprecedented view of ongoing epigenetic reprogramming in a wild population.},

Current controversies may be resolved through a more careful regard of this complexity, and of the immense taxonomic variability of carotenoid metabolism. Studies investigating the physiological trade-offs between ornamental and physiological uses of carotenoids have yielded inconsistent results. However, in many studies, homeostatic regulation of immune and antioxidant systems may have obscured the effects of carotenoid supplementation. We highlight how carefully designed experiments can overcome such complications. There is also a need to investigate factors other than physiological trade-offs (such as predation risk and social interactions) as these, too, may shape the expression of carotenoidbased signals. Moreover, the processes limiting signal expression individuals are likely different from those operating over evolutionary time-scales. Future research should give greater attention to carotenoid pigmentation outside the area of sexual selection, and to taxa other than fishes and birds.},

This heredity is often mediated by epigenetic regulations of gene expression and may be transferred even across several generations. In this review, we focus on studies which involve transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI), with a short detour to intergenerational studies focused on the inheritance of trauma or stressful experiences. The reviewed studies show a plethora of universal changes which stress exposure initiates on multiple levels of organisation ranging from hormonal production and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis modulation all the way to cognition, behaviour, or propensity to certain psychiatric or metabolic disorders. This review will also provide an overview of relevant methodology and difficulties linked to implementation of epigenetic studies. A better understanding of these processes may help us elucidate the evolutionary pathways which are at work in the course of emergence of the diseases and disorders associated with exposure to trauma, either direct or in a previous generation.},

However, quantifying inbreeding depression in wild populations is challenging, requiring large sample sizes, detailed knowledge of life histories and study over many generations. Here we report analyses of the effects of close inbreeding, based on observations of mating between relatives, in a large, free-living noninsular great tit (Parus major) population monitored over 41{$\quad$}years. Although mating between close relatives (f{$\quad\geq\quad$}0.125) was rare (1.0--2.6\% of matings, depending on data set restrictiveness), we found pronounced inbreeding depression, which translated into reduced hatching success, fledging success, recruitment to the breeding population and production of grand offspring. An inbred mating at f{$\quad$}={$\quad$}0.25 had a 39\% reduction in fitness relative to that of an outbred nest, when calculated in terms of recruitment success, and a 55\% reduction in the number of fledged grand offspring. Our data show that inbreeding depression acts independently at each life-history stage in this population, and hence suggest that estimates of the fitness costs of inbreeding must focus on the entire life cycle.},

Although this response can be costly, conceptual models suggest that it can also recalibrate the stress response system, priming more effective responses to future challenges. Little is known about whether this process occurs in wild animals, particularly in adulthood, and if so, how information about prior experience with stressors is encoded. One potential mechanism is hormonally mediated changes in DNA methylation. We simulated the spikes in corticosterone that accompany a stress response using non-invasive dosing in tree swallows (               Tachycineta bicolor               ) and monitored the phenotypic effects 1\,year later. In a subset of individuals, we characterized DNA methylation using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing shortly after treatment and a year later. The year after treatment, experimental females had stronger negative feedback and initiated breeding earlier---traits that are associated with stress resilience and reproductive performance in our population---and higher baseline corticosterone. We also found that natural variation in corticosterone predicted patterns of DNA methylation. Finally, corticosterone treatment influenced methylation on short (1--2\,weeks) and long (1\,year) time scales; however, these changes did not have clear links to functional regulation of the stress response. Taken together, our results are consistent with corticosterone-induced priming of future stress resilience and support DNA methylation as a potential mechanism, but more work is needed to demonstrate functional consequences. Uncovering the mechanisms linking experience with the response to future challenges has implications for understanding the drivers of stress resilience.},

  abstract = {Individuals often differ in their ability to cope with challenging environmental and social conditions. Evidence from model systems suggests that patterns of DNA methylation are associated with variation in coping ability. These associations could arise directly if methylation plays a role in controlling the physiological response to stressors by, among other things, regulating the release of glucocorticoids in response to challenges. Alternatively, the association could arise indirectly if methylation and resilience have a common cause, such as early-life conditions. In either case, methylation might act as a biomarker for coping ability. At present, however, relatively little is known about whether variation in methylation is associated with organismal performance and resilience under natural conditions. We studied genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation in free-living female tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) and a tree swallow genome that was assembled for this study. We identified areas of the genome that were differentially methylated with respect to social signal expression (breast brightness) and physiological traits (ability to terminate the glucocorticoid stress response through negative feedback). We also asked whether methylation predicted resilience to a subsequent experimentally imposed challenge. Individuals with brighter breast plumage and higher stress resilience had lower methylation at differentially methylated regions across the genome. Thus, widespread differences in methylation predicted both social signal expression and the response to future challenges under natural conditions. These results have implications for predicting individual differences in resilience, and for understanding the mechanistic basis of resilience and its environmental and social mediators.},

  abstract = {Melatonin is a molecule present in a multitude of taxa and may be ubiquitous in organisms. It has been found in bacteria, unicellular eukaryotes, macroalgae, fungi, plants and animals. A primary biological function of melatonin in primitive unicellular organisms is in antioxidant defence to protect against toxic free radical damage. During evolution, melatonin has been adopted by multicellular organisms to perform many other biological functions. These functions likely include the chemical expression of darkness in vertebrates, environmental tolerance in fungi and plants, sexual signaling in birds and fish, seasonal reproductive regulation in photoperiodic mammals, and immunomodulation and anti-inflammatory activity in all vertebrates tested. Moreover, its waning production during aging may indicate senescence in terms of a bio-clock in many organisms. Conversely, high melatonin levels can serve as a signal of vitality and health. The multiple biological functions of melatonin can partially be attributed to its unconventional metabolism which is comprised of multi-enzymatic, pseudo-enzymatic and non-enzymatic pathways. As a result, several bioactive metabolites of melatonin are formed during its metabolism and some of the presumed biological functions of melatonin reported to date may, in fact, be mediated by these metabolites. The changing biological roles of melatonin seem to have evolved from its primary function as an antioxidant.},

Having described the essence of SEM in the context of causal analysis, the author discusses the years of the development of structural modeling as the consequence of many researchers' systematically growing needs (in particular in the social sciences) who strove to effectively understand the structure and interactions of latent phenomena. The early beginnings of SEM models were related to the work of Spearman and Wright, and to that of other prominent researchers who contributed to SEM development. The importance and predominance of theoretical assumptions over technical issues for the successful construction of SEM models are also described. Then, controversies regarding the use of SEM in the social sciences are presented. Finally, the opportunities and threats of this type of analytical strategy as well as selected areas of SEM applications in the social sciences are discussed.},

However, high variation may also support deleterious alleles through genetic load, unless purged, thereby increasing the risk of inbreeding depression if population sizes decrease rapidly. Purging of deleterious variation has now been demonstrated in some threatened species. However, less is known about the costs of population declines and inbreeding in species with large population sizes and high genetic diversity even though this encompasses many species globally that have or are expected to undergo rapid population declines. Caribou is a species of ecological and cultural significance in North America with a continental-wide distribution supporting extensive phenotypic variation, but with some populations undergoing significant declines resulting in their at-risk status in Canada. We assessed intra-specific genetic variation, adaptive divergence, inbreeding, and genetic load across populations with different demographic histories using an annotated chromosome-scale reference genome and 66 whole genome sequences. We found high genetic diversity and nine phylogenomic lineages across the continent with adaptive diversification of genes, but also high genetic load among lineages. We also found highly divergent levels of inbreeding across individuals including the loss of alleles by drift (genetic erosion) but not purging, likely due to rapid population declines not allowing time for purging of deleterious alleles. As a result, further inbreeding may need to be mitigated through conservation efforts. Our results highlight the `double-edged sword' of genetic diversity that may be representative of other species-at-risk affected by anthropogenic activities.},

These patterns of variation have been identified in many animal taxa and are likely to have important ecological and evolutionary consequences. Despite their importance, genetic and environmental sources of variation in personalities have rarely been characterized in wild populations. We used a Bayesian animal model approach to estimate genetic parameters for aggression, activity and docility in North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). We found support for low heritabilities (0.08-0.12), and cohort effects (0.07-0.09), as well as low to moderate maternal effects (0.07-0.15) and permanent environmental effects (0.08-0.16). Finally, we found evidence of a substantial positive genetic correlation (0.68) and maternal effects correlation (0.58) between activity and aggression providing evidence of genetically based behavioural correlations in red squirrels. These results provide evidence for the presence of heritable variation in red squirrel behaviour, but also emphasize the role of other sources of variation, including maternal effects, in shaping patterns of variation and covariation in behavioural traits. {\copyright} 2012 The Authors.

  abstract = {In many species, courtship displays are reliable signals of male quality, and current hypotheses suggest that these displays allow females to choose males with high cellular function. Environmental stressors generate excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) that impair cellular function, and thus antioxidant pathways that remove ROS are probably critical for preserving complex sexual behaviours. Here, we test the hypothesis that enhanced antioxidant activity in mitochondria preserves mating performance following oxidative stress. Using a transgenic approach, we directly manipulated mitochondrial antioxidant activity in the Caribbean fruit fly,               Anastrepha suspensa,               a lek-mating species with elaborate sexual displays and intense sexual selection that is also a model for sterile insect technique programmes. We generated seven transgenic lines that overexpress mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). Radiation is a severe oxidative stressor used to induce sterility for sterile insect programmes. After radiation treatment, two lines with intermediate MnSOD overexpression showed enhanced mating performance relative to wild-type males. These improvements in mating corresponded with reduced oxidative damage to lipids, demonstrating that MnSOD overexpression protects flies from oxidative stress at the cellular level. For lines with improved mating performance, overexpression also preserved locomotor activity, as indicated by a laboratory climbing assay. Our results show a clear link between oxidative stress, antioxidant capacity and male performance. Our work has implications for fundamentally understanding the role of antioxidants in sexual selection, and shows promise for using transgenic approaches to enhance the field performance of insects released for area-wide pest management strategies and improving performance of biological control agents in general.},

The field of conservation genetics aims at preserving species by using their levels of genetic diversity, usually measured as neutral genome-wide diversity, as a barometer for evaluating population health and extinction risk. A fundamental assumption is that higher levels of genetic diversity lead to an increase in fitness and long-term survival of a species. Here, we argue against the perceived importance of neutral genetic diversity for the conservation of wild populations and species. We demonstrate that no simple general relationship exists between neutral genetic diversity and the risk of species extinction. Instead, a better understanding of the properties of functional genetic diversity, demographic history, and ecological relationships is necessary for developing and implementing effective conservation genetic strategies.},

  abstract = {Human emotions play a key role in numerous decision-making processes. The ability to correctly identify likes and dislikes as well as excitement and boredom would facilitate novel applications in neuromarketing, affective entertainment, virtual rehabilitation and forensic neuroscience that leverage on sub-conscious human affective states. In this neuroinformatics investigation, we seek to recognize human preferences and excitement passively through the use of electroencephalography (EEG) when a subject is presented with some 3D visual stimuli. Our approach employs the use of machine learning in the form of deep neural networks to classify brain signals acquired using a brain-computer interface (BCI). In the first part of our study, we attempt to improve upon our previous work, which has shown that EEG preference classification is possible although accuracy rates remain relatively low at 61\%-67\% using conventional deep learning neural architectures, where the challenge mainly lies in the accurate classification of unseen data from a cohort-wide sample that introduces inter-subject variability on top of the existing intra-subject variability. Such an approach is significantly more challenging and is known as subject-independent EEG classification as opposed to the more commonly adopted but more time-consuming and less general approach of subject-dependent EEG classification. In this new study, we employ deep networks that allow dropouts to occur in the architecture of the neural network. The results obtained through this simple feature modification achieved a classification accuracy of up to 79\%. Therefore, this study has shown that the use of a deep learning classifier was able to achieve an increase in emotion classification accuracy of between 13\% and 18\% through the simple adoption of the use of dropouts compared to a conventional deep learner for EEG preference classification. In the second part of our study, users are exposed to a roller-coaster experience as the emotional stimuli which are expected to evoke the emotion of excitement, while simultaneously wearing virtual reality goggles, which delivers the virtual reality experience of excitement, and an EEG headset, acquires the raw brain signals detected when exposed to this excitement stimuli. Here, a deep learning approach is used to improve the excitement detection rate to well above the 90\% accuracy level. In a prior similar study, the use of conventional machine learning approaches involving k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) classifiers and Support Vector Machines (SVM) only achieved prediction accuracy rates of between 65\% and 89\%. Using a deep learning approach here, rates of 78\%-96\% were achieved. This demonstrates the superiority of adopting a deep learning approach over other machine learning approaches for detecting human excitement when immersed in an immersive virtual reality environment.},

The combination of these effects constitutes a challenge for both the survival and persistence of many native species, while also imposing altered selective regimes. Here, using 110 314 single nucleotide polymorphisms generated by restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing, we investigated the genome-wide effects of urbanization on putative neutral and adaptive genomic diversity in a major insect pollinator,               Bombus lapidarius               , collected from nine German cities and nine paired rural sites. Overall, genetic differentiation among sites was low and there was no obvious genome-wide genetic structuring, suggesting the absence of strong effects of urbanization on gene flow. We nevertheless identified several loci under directional selection, a subset of which was associated with urban land use, including the percentage of impervious surface surrounding each sampling site. Overall, our results provide evidence of local adaptation to urbanization in the face of gene flow in a highly mobile insect pollinator.},

I recorded all birds detected within 100 m-wide strip transects, walked at random through every forest type all day long. The frequency of records per 10 h and flock sizes on each transect were averaged over all surveys in each study site (N = 3025 h). Censused groups included terrestrial (tinamous, woodquails, curassow and trumpeter) and arboreal species (guans, macaws, parrots, toucans), but not waterbirds. The abundance of all game birds was higher in non-hunted than in hunted areas, though not always significantly for secretive understorey species (tinamous, guans, wood-quail) or canopy frugivores (parrots, macaws, toucans). The Black Curassow and Gray-winged Trumpeter exhibited the highest and most consistent increases (7--10-fold) and more so between intermediate and non-hunted sites than between hunted and intermediate sites. The mean flock size also increased along the hunting gradient, especially in flocking species (macaws, parrots, trumpeter). Low reproductive rates and/or seasonal movements may explain that hunting pressure could still be felt after hunting has ceased or when it persists only away from a given area. Such a persistent effect would affect some populations in small protected areas.},

Yet, we usually need a suitable reference genome for mapping population-level resequencing data. In some model systems, multiple reference genomes are available, giving the challenging task of determining which reference genome best suits the data. Here, we compared the use of two different reference genomes for the three-spined stickleback (               Gasterosteus aculeatus               ), one novel genome derived from a European gynogenetic individual and the published reference genome of a North American individual. Specifically, we investigated the impact of using a local reference versus one generated from a distinct lineage on several common population genomics analyses. Through mapping genome resequencing data of 60 sticklebacks from across Europe and North America, we demonstrate that genetic distance among samples and the reference genomes impacts downstream analyses. Using a local reference genome increased mapping efficiency and genotyping accuracy, effectively retaining more and better data. Despite comparable distributions of the metrics generated across the genome using SNP data (i.e. {$\pi$}, Tajima's               D               and               F               ST               ), window-based statistics using different references resulted in different outlier genes and enriched gene functions. A marker-based analysis of DNA methylation distributions had a comparably high overlap in outlier genes and functions, yet with distinct differences depending on the reference genome. Overall, our results highlight how using a local reference genome decreases reference bias to increase confidence in downstream analyses of the data. Such results have significant implications in all reference-genome-based population genomic analyses.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Personality (i.e., among-individual variation in average behavior) often covaries with fitness, but how such personality--fitness relationships come about is poorly understood. Here, we explore potential mechanisms by which two female personality traits (female--female aggression and female nest defense as manifested by hissing behavior) were linked with annual reproductive success in a population of great tits (Parus major), a socially monogamous species with biparental care. We hypothesized that personality-related differences in reproductive success result from variation in reproductive decision (lay date, brood size) and/or parental provisioning rates. Relative support for these mechanisms was evaluated using path analysis on data collected in two successive years. We reveal that larger broods were provisioned at a higher rate by both parents and that female, but not male, provisioning rate was involved in the trade-off between offspring number (brood size) and fledgling mass. Among-individual variation in female aggression, via its association with female provisioning rate, was negatively linked to fledgling mass (i.e., indirect effect), yet only in one of the study years. Male provisioning rate did not influence these relationships. In contrast, among-individual variation in hissing behavior was directly and negatively linked with fledgling mass in both years, via an underlying mechanism that remains to be identified (i.e., direct effect). Together, our findings emphasize that personality--fitness relationships may come about via different mechanisms across personality traits and/or years, thereby illustrating additional complexity in how selection might act on and maintain among-individual variation in behavioral phenotypes in the wild.},

  abstract = {Gene flow is a fundamental evolutionary force in adaptation that is especially important to understand as humans are rapidly changing both the natural environment and natural levels of gene flow. Theory proposes a multifaceted role for gene flow in adaptation, but it focuses mainly on the disruptive effect that gene flow has on adaptation when selection is not strong enough to prevent the loss of locally adapted alleles. The role of gene flow in adaptation is now better understood due to the recent development of both genomic models of adaptive evolution and genomic techniques, which both point to the importance of genetic architecture in the origin and maintenance of adaptation with gene flow. In this review, we discuss three main topics on the genomics of adaptation with gene flow. First, we investigate selection on migration and gene flow. Second, we discuss the three potential sources of adaptive variation in relation to the role of gene flow in the origin of adaptation. Third, we explain how local adaptation is maintained despite gene flow: we provide a synthesis of recent genomic models of adaptation, discuss the genomic mechanisms and review empirical studies on the genomics of adaptation with gene flow. Despite predictions on the disruptive effect of gene flow in adaptation, an increasing number of studies show that gene flow can promote adaptation, that local adaptations can be maintained despite high gene flow, and that genetic architecture plays a fundamental role in the origin and maintenance of local adaptation with gene flow.},

How these two factors affect an individual's ability to leave offspring in the next generation is a major component of evolutionary theory, but evidence for a direct relationship has been lacking. By estimating the contribution of partially recessive mutations to additive genetic variation in seed-feeding cow-pea weevils over a seven-generation pedigree breeding program involving variation in levels of inbreeding,                                Tomkins                 et al.

Correspondingly, ``good genes'' models of sexual selection and recent models for the evolution of sex are built on the assumption that mutational loads and breeding values for fitness-related traits are correlated. In support of this concept, inbreeding depression was negatively genetically correlated with breeding values for traits under natural and sexual selection in the weevil               Callosobruchus maculatus               . The correlations were stronger in males and strongest for condition. These results confirm the role of existing, partially recessive mutations in maintaining additive genetic variation in outbred populations, reveal the nature of good genes under sexual selection, and show how sexual selection can offset the cost of sex.},

We present a conceptual framework that distinguishes three mechanisms of organism--environment interaction. We call these NC3 mechanisms: niche construction, in which individuals make changes to the environment; niche choice, in which individuals select an environment; and niche conformance, in which individuals adjust their phenotypes in response to the environment. Each of these individual-level mechanisms affects an individual's phenotype--environment match, its fitness, and its individualized niche, defined in terms of the environmental conditions under which the individual can survive and reproduce. Our framework identifies how individuals alter the selective regimes that they and other organisms experience. It also places clear emphasis on individual differences and construes niche construction and other processes as evolved mechanisms. The NC3 mechanism framework therefore helps to integrate population-level and individual-level research.},

In the present study, we develop novel seasonal resilience phenotypes reflecting milk production changes to fluctuating weather. We evaluate the impact of calendar season (autumn, winter and spring) on animal performance resilience by analysing 420,534 milk records of 36,908 milking ewes of the Chios breed together with relevant meteorological data from eastern Mediterranean. We reveal substantial seasonal effects on resilience and significant heritable trait variation (h 2 = 0.03--0.17). Resilience to cold weather (10 {$^\circ$}C) of animals that start producing milk in spring was under different genetic control compared to autumn and winter as exemplified by negative genetic correlations (- 0.09 to - 0.27). Animal resilience to hot weather (25 {$^\circ$}C) was partially under the same genetic control with genetic correlations between seasons ranging from 0.43 to 0.86. We report both favourable and antagonistic associations between animal resilience and lifetime milk production, depending on calendar season and the desirable direction of genetic selection. Concluding, we emphasise on seasonal adaptation of animals to climate and the need to incorporate the novel seasonal traits in future selective breeding programmes.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Sexual selection on males is predicted to increase population fitness, and delay population extinction, when mating success negatively covaries with genetic load across individuals. However, such benefits of sexual selection could be counteracted by simultaneous increases in genome-wide drift resulting from reduced effective population size caused by increased variance in fitness. Resulting fixation of deleterious mutations could be greatest in small populations, and when environmental variation in mating traits partially decouples sexual selection from underlying genetic variation. The net consequences of sexual selection for genetic load and population persistence are therefore likely to be context dependent, but such variation has not been examined. We use a genetically explicit individual-based model to show that weak sexual selection can increase population persistence time compared to random mating. However, for stronger sexual selection such positive effects can be overturned by the detrimental effects of increased genome-wide drift. Furthermore, the relative strengths of mutation-purging and drift critically depend on the environmental variance in the male mating trait. Specifically, increasing environmental variance caused stronger sexual selection to elevate deleterious mutation fixation rate and mean selection coefficient, driving rapid accumulation of drift load and decreasing population persistence times. These results highlight an intricate balance between conflicting positive and negative consequences of sexual selection on genetic load, even in the absence of sexually antagonistic selection. They imply that environmental variances in key mating traits, and intrinsic genetic drift, should be properly factored into future theoretical and empirical studies of the evolution of population fitness under sexual selection.},

The water samples were collected from Bistri{\textcommabelow t}a-N{\u a}s{\u a}ud County, from three trout farms: Str{\^a}mba, {\textcommabelow S}oimul de Jos and Fiad, in the summer of 2018, between May and August.

The samples collection was made in each farm from three different places: catchment, basins and evacuation water areas. The results of the study showed that the parameters observed from the three farms were different, with major differences in month of July and August. The environment of fish aquaculture is a complex system with critical parameters as are the temperature, suspended solids, dissolved oxygen, nitrite and ammonia. However, the temperature and the dissolved oxygen are the most important parameter, requiring continuous monitoring in aquaculture production systems, due to the fish aerobic metabolism which requires an elevated level of dissolved oxygen at optimum temperatures.},

Snow sheep (Ovis nivicola) could represent a good candidate for this; as the only large herbivore species adapted to the cold and alpine habitats of northeastern Siberia, it plays a crucial role in its ecosystem. Despite having an extensive geographical distribution among all ovine species, it is one of the least studied. In this study, we sequenced and analysed six genomes of snow sheep in combination with all other wild sheep species to infer key aspects of their evolutionary history and unveil the genetic basis of their adaptation to subarctic environments. Despite their large census population size, snow sheep genomes showed remarkably low heterozygosity, which could reflect the effect of isolation and historical bottlenecks that we inferred using the pairwise sequential Markovian coalescent and runs of homozygosity. F4-\-statistics indicated instances of introgression involving snow sheep with argali (Ovis ammon) and Dall (Ovis dalli) sheep, suggesting that these species might have been more widespread during the Pleistocene. Furthermore, the introgressed segments, which were identified using mainly minimum relative node depth, covered genes associated with immunity, adipogenesis and morphology-\-related traits, representing potential targets of adaptive introgression. Genes related to mitochondrial functions and thermogenesis associated with adipose tissue were identified to be under selection. Overall, our data suggest introgression as a mechanism facilitating adaptation in wild sheep species and provide insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying cold adaptation in snow sheep.},

However, demonstrating that fisheries-induced phenotypic changes in the wild are at least partly genetically determined has proved notoriously difficult. Moreover, the population-level consequences of fisheries-induced evolution are still being controversially discussed. Using an experimental approach, we found that five generations of size-selective harvesting altered the life histories and behavior, but not the metabolic rate, of wild-origin zebrafish (Danio rerio). Fish adapted to high positively size selective fishing pressure invested more in reproduction, reached a smaller adult body size, and were less explorative and bold. Phenotypic changes seemed subtle but were accompanied by genetic changes in functional loci. Thus, our results provided unambiguous evidence for rapid, harvest-induced phenotypic and evolutionary change when harvesting is intensive and size selective. According to a life-history model, the observed life-history changes elevated population growth rate in harvested conditions, but slowed population recovery under a simulated moratorium. Hence, the evolutionary legacy of size-selective harvesting includes populations that are productive under exploited conditions, but selectively disadvantaged to cope with natural selection pressures that often favor large body size.},

  abstract = {Microsatellite variability is widely used to infer levels of genetic diversity in natural populations. However, the ascertainment bias caused by typically selecting only the most polymorphic markers in the genome may lead to reduced sensitivity for judging genomewide levels of genetic diversity. To test this potential limitation of microsatellite-based approaches, we assessed the degree of nucleotide diversity in noncoding regions of eight different carnivore populations, including inbred as well as outbred populations, by sequencing 10 introns (5.4--5.7 kb) in 20 individuals of each population (wolves, coyotes, wolverines and lynxes). Estimates of nucleotide diversity varied 30-fold (7.1 {\texttimes} 10--5 --2.1 {\texttimes} 10--3), with densities of one single nucleotide polymorphism every 112--5446 bp. Microsatellite genotyping (10--27 markers) of the same animals revealed mean multilocus heterozygosities of 0.54--0.78, a 1.4-fold difference among populations. There was a positive yet not perfect (r2 = 0.70) correlation between microsatellite marker heterozygosity and nucleotide diversity at the population level. For example, point estimates of nucleotide diversity varied in some cases with an order of magnitude despite very similar levels of microsatellite marker heterozygosity. Moreover, at the individual level, no significant correlation was found. Our results imply that variability at microsatellite marker sets typically used in population studies may not accurately reflect the underlying genomic diversity. This suggests that researchers should consider using resequencing-based approaches for assessing genetic diversity when accurate inference is critical, as in many conservation and management contexts.},

  abstract = {Abstract           It is commonly thought that declining populations will experience negative genetic consequences as a result of increased inbreeding. Here we estimated the average deleteriousness of derived alleles in a range of mammals and found that species with historically small population size and low genetic diversity often have lower genetic load than species with large population sizes. This is likely the result of genetic purging -- the more efficient removal of partially deleterious recessive alleles from inbred populations. Our findings suggest that genetic purging occurs over long evolutionary time frames, and therefore rapid population declines are likely to dis-proportionally increase mutational load in species with high diversity, as they carry many deleterious alleles that can reach fixation before genetic purging can remove them.},

However, despite concerns about negative fitness effects resulting from increased genetic drift and inbreeding, there is a lack of empirical data on genomic changes in conjunction with such declines [3--7]. Here, we use whole genomes recovered from century-old historical museum specimens to quantify the genomic consequences of small population size in the critically endangered Grauer's and endangered mountain gorillas. We find a reduction of genetic diversity and increase in inbreeding and genetic load in the Grauer's gorilla, which experienced severe population declines in recent decades. In contrast, the small but relatively stable mountain gorilla population has experienced little genomic change during the last century. These results suggest that species histories as well as the rate of demographic change may influence how population declines affect genome diversity.},

Here, we report the first large meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of aggressive behavior (               N               \,=\,15,324 participants). In peripheral blood samples of 14,434 participants from 18 cohorts with mean ages ranging from 7 to 68 years, 13 methylation sites were significantly associated with aggression (alpha\,=\,1.2\,{\texttimes}\,10               -7               ; Bonferroni correction). In cord blood samples of 2425 children from five cohorts with aggression assessed at mean ages ranging from 4 to 7 years, 83\% of these sites showed the same direction of association with childhood aggression (               r               \,=\,0.74,               p               \,=\,0.006) but no epigenome-wide significant sites were found. Top-sites (48 at a false discovery rate of 5\% in the peripheral blood meta-analysis or in a combined meta-analysis of peripheral blood and cord blood) have been associated with chemical exposures, smoking, cognition, metabolic traits, and genetic variation (mQTLs). Three genes whose expression levels were associated with top-sites were previously linked to schizophrenia and general risk tolerance. At six CpGs, DNA methylation variation in blood mirrors variation in the brain. On average 44\% (range\,=\,3--82\%) of the aggression--methylation association was explained by current and former smoking and BMI. These findings point at loci that are sensitive to chemical exposures with potential implications for neuronal functions. We hope these results to be a starting point for studies leading to applications as peripheral biomarkers and to reveal causal relationships with aggression and related traits.},

Linkage maps provide a valuable tool for the unravelling of such trait-gene associations. Moreover, they give insight into recombination landscapes and between-species karyotype evolution. Here we used genotype data, generated from a 10k single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip, of over 2000 individuals to produce high-density linkage maps of the great tit (Parus major), a passerine bird that serves as a model species for ecological and evolutionary questions. We created independent maps from two distinct populations: a captive F2-cross from The Netherlands (NL) and a wild population from the United Kingdom (UK). The two maps contained 6554 SNPs in 32 linkage groups, spanning 2010\,cM and 1917\,cM for the NL and UK populations, respectively, and were similar in size and marker order. Subtle levels of heterochiasmy within and between chromosomes were remarkably consistent between the populations, suggesting that the local departures from sex-equal recombination rates have evolved. This key and surprising result would have been impossible to detect if only one population was mapped. A comparison with zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata, chicken Gallus gallus and the green anole lizard Anolis carolinensis genomes provided further insight into the evolution of avian karyotypes.},

  abstract = {Inbreeding depression, the reduced fitness of the offspring of related individuals, can affect males and females differently. Although a comprehensive theoretical framework describing the causes of sex-\-specific inbreeding depression is lacking, empirical evidence suggests that often one sex tends to be more vulnerable than the other. However, the generality, direction, and degree of sex-\-specific difference in inbreeding depression remains enigmatic as studies on this topic have reported conflicting results. Here, we conduct a meta-\-analysis to test for sex-\-specific differences in the magnitude of inbreeding depression. We synthetised 321 effect sizes of experimental studies across 47 species and found a small difference in inbreeding depression between the sexes: females suffered slightly higher inbreeding depression than males. Furthermore, a higher inbreeding coefficient was correlated with higher inbreeding depression. However, there was a large amount of heterogeneity that remained unexplained, even when considering different factors that could affect inbreeding between the sexes, such as sexual size dimorphism, heterogamety, the type of trait measured and whether animals were tested in a stressful environment. As such, we highlight the need to further explore inbreeding depression across different species to determine the occurrence and causes of sex differences to increase our understanding of the evolutionary consequences of sex-\-specific inbreeding depression.},

  abstract = {The field of molecular ecology is transitioning from the use of small panels of classical genetic markers such as microsatellites to much larger panels of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) generated by approaches like RAD sequencing. However, few empirical studies have directly compared the ability of these methods to resolve population structure. This could have implications for understanding phenotypic plasticity, as many previous studies of natural populations may have lacked the power to detect genetic differences, especially over micro-geographic scales. We therefore compared the ability of microsatellites and RAD sequencing to resolve fine-scale population structure in a commercially important benthic invertebrate by genotyping great scallops (               Pecten maximus               ) from nine populations around Northern Ireland at 13 microsatellites and 10\,539 SNPs. The shells were then subjected to morphometric and colour analysis in order to compare patterns of phenotypic and genetic variation. We found that RAD sequencing was superior at resolving population structure, yielding higher               F               st               values and support for two distinct genetic clusters, whereas only one cluster could be detected in a Bayesian analysis of the microsatellite dataset. Furthermore, appreciable phenotypic variation was observed in size-independent shell shape and coloration, including among localities that could not be distinguished from one another genetically, providing support for the notion that these traits are phenotypically plastic. Taken together, our results suggest that RAD sequencing is a powerful approach for studying population structure and phenotypic plasticity in natural populations.},

Several mechanisms are hypothesized to explain CGP including natural selection, spatiotemporal fluctuations in larval source populations, self-recruitment, and sweepstake reproduction. Discriminating among them is extremely difficult but is fundamental to understanding how marine organisms reproduce and disperse. Here, we report a notable example of CGP in the Antarctic limpet, an unusually tractable system where multiple confounding explanations can be discounted. Using population genomics, temporally replicated sampling, surface drifters, and forward genetic simulations, we show that CGP likely arises from an extreme sweepstake event together with collective larval dispersal, while selection appears to be unimportant. Our results illustrate the importance of neutral demographic forces in natural populations and have important implications for understanding the recruitment dynamics, population connectivity, local adaptation, and resilience of marine populations.},

Before inheritance of methylation patterns can be characterized, we need a better understanding of how environmental change modifies the parental epigenome. To examine the influence of experimental ocean acidification on eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) gonad tissue, oysters were cultured in the laboratory under control (491 {\textpm} 49 {$\mu$}atm) or high (2550 {\textpm} 211 {$\mu$}atm) pCO2 conditions for 4 weeks. DNA from reproductive tissue was isolated from five oysters per treatment, then subjected to bisulfite treatment and DNA sequencing. Irrespective of treatment, DNA methylation was primarily found in gene bodies with approximately 22\% of CpGs (2.7\% of total cytosines) in the C. virginica genome predicted to be methylated. In response to elevated pCO2, we found 598 differentially methylated loci primarily overlapping with gene bodies. A majority of differentially methylated loci were in exons (61.5\%) with less intron overlap (31.9\%). While there was no evidence of a significant tendency for the genes with differentially methylated loci to be associated with distinct biological processes, the concentration of these loci in gene bodies, including genes involved in protein ubiquitination and biomineralization, suggests DNA methylation may be important for transcriptional control in response to ocean acidification. Changes in gonad methylation also indicate potential for these methylation patterns to be inherited by offspring. Understanding how experimental ocean acidification conditions modify the oyster epigenome, and if these modifications are inherited, allows for a better understanding of how ecosystems will respond to environmental change.},

  abstract = {The importance of DNA methylation in plastic responses to environmental change and evolutionary dynamics is increasingly recognized. Here, we provide a Perspective piece on the diverse roles of DNA methylation on broad evolutionary timescales, including (i) short-term transient acclimation, (ii) stable phenotypic evolution, and (iii) genomic evolution. We show that epi\- genetic responses vary along a continuum, ranging from short-term acclimatory responses in variable environments within a generation to long-term modifications in populations and species. DNA methylation thus unlocks additional potential for or\- ganisms to rapidly acclimate to their environment over short timeframes. If these changes affect fitness, they can circumvent the need for adaptive changes at the genome level. However, methylation has a complex reciprocal relationship with genetic variation as it can be genetically controlled, yet it can also induce point mutations and contribute to genomic evolution. When habitats remain constant over many generations, or populations are separated across habitats, initially plastic phenotypes can become hardwired through epigenetically facilitated mutagenesis. It remains unclear under what circumstances plasticity contributes to evolutionary outcomes, and when plastic changes will become permanently encoded into genotype. We high\- light how studies investigating the evolution of epigenetic plasticity need to carefully consider how plasticity in methylation state could evolve among different evolutionary scenarios, the possible phenotypic outcomes, its effects on genomic evolu\- tion, and the proximate energetic and ultimate fitness costs of methylation. We argue that accumulating evidence suggests that DNA methylation can contribute toward evolution on various timescales, spanning a continuum from acclimatory plas\- ticity to genomic evolution.},

However, studies reporting associations between genome-wide epigenetic changes and habitat-specific variations in life history traits (e.g., lifespan, reproduction) are still scarce, likely due to the recent application of methylome resequencing methods to non-model species. In this study, we examined associations between whole genome DNA methylation and environmentally driven life history variation in 2 lineages of a marine fish, the capelin (Mallotus villosus), from North America and Europe. In both lineages, capelin harbor 2 contrasting life history tactics (demersal vs. beach-spawning). Performing whole genome and methylome sequencing, we showed that life history tactics are associated with epigenetic changes in both lineages, though the effect was stronger in European capelin. Genetic differentiation between the capelin harboring different life history tactics was negligible, but we found genome-wide methylation changes in both lineages. We identified 9,125 European and 199 North American differentially methylated regions (DMRs) due to life history. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis for both lineages revealed an excess of terms related to neural function. Our results suggest that environmental variation causes important epigenetic changes that are associated with contrasting life history tactics in lineages with divergent genetic backgrounds, with variable importance of genetic variation in driving epigenetic variation. Our study emphasizes the potential role of genome-wide epigenetic variation in adaptation to environmental variation.},

  abstract = {Inbreeding depression is the loss of fitness resulting from the mating of genetically related individuals. Traditionally, the study of inbreeding depression focused on genetic effects, although recent research has identified DNA methylation as also having a role in inbreeding effects. Since inbreeding depression and DNA methylation change with age and environmental stress, DNA methylation is a likely candidate for the regulation of genes associated with inbreeding depression. Here, we use a targeted, multigene approach to assess methylation at 22 growth-, metabolic-, immune- and stress-related genes. We developed PCR-based DNA methylation assays to test the effects of intense inbreeding on intragenic gene-specific methylation in inbred and outbred Chinook salmon. Inbred fish had altered methylation at three genes, CK-1, GTIIBS and hsp70, suggesting that methylation changes associated with inbreeding depression are targeted to specific genes and are not whole-genome effects. While we did not find a significant inbreeding by age interaction, we found that DNA methylation generally increases with age, although methylation decreased with age in five genes, CK-1, IFN-{$\gamma$}, HNRNPL, hsc71 and FSHb, potentially due to environmental context and sexual maturation. As expected, we found methylation patterns differed among tissue types, highlighting the need for careful selection of target tissue for methylation studies. This study provides insight into the role of epigenetic effects on ageing, environmental response and tissue function in Chinook salmon and shows that methylation is a targeted and regulated cellular process. We provide the first evidence of epigenetically based inbreeding depression in vertebrates.},

Since environmental change can induce shifts in the genetic architecture and plasticity of traits, it is important to consider both genetic and environmental sources of phenotypic variation. While there is overwhelming evidence for environmental effects on phenotype, the underlying mechanisms are less clear. Variation in DNA methylation is a potential mechanism mediating environmental effects on phenotype due to its sensitivity to environmental stimuli, transgenerational inheritance, and influences on transcription. To characterize the effect of environment on methylation, we created two 6 {\texttimes} 6 (North Carolina II) Chinook salmon breeding crosses and reared the offspring in two environments: uniform hatchery tanks and seminatural stream channels. We sampled the fish twice during development, at the alevin (larval) and fry (juvenile) stages. We measured DNA methylation at 13 genes using a PCR-based bisulfite sequencing protocol. The genetic architecture of DNA methylation differed between rearing environments, with greater additive and nonadditive genetic variance in hatchery fish and greater maternal effects in seminatural channel fish, though gene-specific variation was evident. We observed plasticity in methylation across all assayed genes, as well as gene-specific effects at two genes in alevin and six genes in fry, indicating developmental stage-specific effects of rearing environment on methylation. Characterizing genetic and environmental influences on methylation is critical for future studies on DNA methylation as a potential mechanism for acclimation and adaptation.},

Here, we assess the epigenetic basis of diversification during the early stages of speciation. Specifically, we focus on the extent and functional relevance of DNA methylome divergence in the very young radiation of               Astatotilapia calliptera               in crater Lake Masoko, southern Tanzania. Our study focuses on two lake ecomorphs that diverged approximately 1,000 years ago and a population in the nearby river from which they separated approximately 10,000 years ago. The two lake ecomorphs show no fixed genetic differentiation, yet are characterized by different morphologies, depth preferences and diets. We report extensive genome-wide methylome divergence between the two lake ecomorphs, and between the lake and river populations, linked to key biological processes and associated with altered transcriptional activity of ecologically relevant genes. Such genes differing between lake ecomorphs include those involved in steroid metabolism, hemoglobin composition and erythropoiesis, consistent with their divergent habitat occupancy. Using a common-garden experiment, we found that global methylation profiles are often rapidly remodeled across generations but ecomorph-specific differences can be inherited. Collectively, our study suggests an epigenetic contribution to the early stages of vertebrate speciation.},

Open science and innovation practices hold great potential for accelerating the learning and creation of new knowledge, speeding up the research and innovation process for finding solutions for grand societal challenges, and nurturing the growth of highly innovative and entrepreneurial people. The purpose of this study was to identify emergent principles, practices, and underlying mechanisms of open science and innovation developed and encountered by research teams at universities. The results of this study provide directions for how to advance openness in science at universities and illustrate how openness in innovation is being remodelled by open science practices.

The question posed for the review was ``which ITs are related to welfare and how do they monitor this for broilers?''. The Welfare Quality{\textregistered} (WQ) protocol for broiler assessment was utilized as a framework to analyse suitable articles. A total of 57 studies were reviewed wherein all principles of broiler welfare were addressed. The ``good health'' principle was the main criteria found to be addressed by ITs and IT-based studies (45.6\% and 46.1\%, respectively), whereas the least observed principle was ``good feeding'' (8.8\%). This review also classified ITs and IT-based studies by their utilization (location, production system, variable measured, aspect of production, and experimental/practical use). The results show that the current focus of ITs is on problems with conventional production systems and that less attention has been given to free-range systems, slaughterhouses, and supply chain issues. Given the valuable results evidenced by the exploitation of ITs, their use in broiler production should continue to be encouraged with more attention given to farmer adoption strategies.},

  abstract = {In seasonal environments, timing of reproduction is a trait with important fitness consequences, but we know little about the molecular mechanisms that underlie the variation in this trait. Recently, several studies put forward DNA methylation as a mechanism regulating seasonal timing of reproduction in both plants and animals. To understand the involvement of DNA methylation in seasonal timing of reproduction, it is necessary to examine within-individual temporal changes in DNA methylation, but such studies are very rare. Here, we use a temporal sampling approach to examine changes in DNA methylation throughout the breeding season in female great tits (Parus major) that were artificially selected for early timing of breeding. These females were housed in climate-controlled aviaries and subjected to two contrasting temperature treatments. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing on red blood cell derived DNA showed genome-wide temporal changes in more than 40,000 out of the 522,643 CpG sites examined. Although most of these changes were relatively small (mean within-individual change of 6\%), the sites that showed a temporal and treatment-specific response in DNA methylation are candidate sites of interest for future studies trying to understand the link between DNA methylation patterns and timing of reproduction.},

The development of this model has allowed us to answer the following questions: Does the consideration of the indirect links between anthropogenic pressures and stream ecological status modify the hierarchy of pressure types impacting benthic invertebrates? Do the different nested scales play different roles in the anthropogenic pressures/ecological status relationship? Does this model lead to better understanding of the specific role of hydromorphology in the evaluation of stream ecological status? To achieve that goal, we used the Partial Least Square (PLS) path modelling method to develop a structural model linking variables describing (i) land use and hydromorphological alterations at the watershed scale, (ii) hydromorphological alterations at the reach scale, (iii) nutrients-organic matter contamination levels at the site scale, and (iv) substrate characteristics at the sampling site scale, to explain variation in values of a macroinvertebrate-based multimetric index: the French I2M2.},

  abstract = {Genetic drift can dramatically change allele frequencies in small populations and lead to reduced levels of genetic diversity, including loss of segregating variants. However, there is a shortage of quantitative studies of how genetic diversity changes over time in natural populations, especially on genome-wide scales. Here, we analyzed whole-genome sequences from 76 wolves of a highly inbred Scandinavian population, founded by only one female and two males, sampled over a period of 30 yr. We obtained chromosome-level haplotypes of all three founders and found that 10\%--24\% of their diploid genomes had become lost after about 20 yr of inbreeding (which approximately corresponds to five generations). Lost haplotypes spanned large genomic regions, as expected from the amount of recombination during this limited time period. Altogether, 160,000 SNP alleles became lost from the population, which may include adaptive variants as well as wild-type alleles masking recessively deleterious alleles. Although not sampled, we could indirectly infer that the two male founders had megabase-sized runs of homozygosity and that all three founders showed significant haplotype sharing, meaning that there were on average only 4.2 unique haplotypes in the six copies of each autosome that the founders brought into the population. This violates the assumption of unrelated founder haplotypes often made in conservation and management of endangered species. Our study provides a novel view of how whole-genome resequencing of temporally stratified samples can be used to visualize and directly quantify the consequences of genetic drift in a small inbred population.},

Environmental change, such as increased rates of urbanization, can induce shifts in phenotypic plasticity with some individuals adapting to city life while others are displaced.                                                     A key trait that can facilitate adaptation is the degree at which animals respond to stressors. This stress response, which includes elevation of baseline circulating concentrations of glucocorticoids, has a heritable component and exhibits intra- and inter-individual variation. However, the mechanisms behind this variability and whether they might be responsible for adaptation to different environments are not known. Variation in DNA methylation can be a potential mechanism that mediates environmental effects on the stress response, as early-life stressors increase glucocorticoid concentrations and change adult phenotype.                                                                          We used an inter- and intra-environmental cross-foster experiment to analyse the contribution of DNA methylation to early-life phenotypic variation. We found that at hatching, urban house wren (                     Troglodytes aedon                     ) offspring had higher methylation frequencies compared with their rural counterparts.                                                                                             We also observed age-related patterns in offspring methylation, indicating the developmental effects of the rearing environment on methylation. At fledgling, differential methylation analyses showed that cellular respiration genes were differentially methylated in broods of different origins and behavioural and metabolism genes were differentially methylated in broods of different rearing environments. Lastly, hyper-methylation of a single gene (                     CNTNAP2                     ) is associated with decreased glucocorticoid levels and the rearing environment.                                                                        These differential methylation patterns linked to a specific physiological phenotype suggest that DNA methylation may be a mechanism by which individuals adjust to novel environments during their lifespan. Characterizing genetic and environmental influences on methylation is critical for understanding the role of epigenetic mechanisms in evolutionary adaptation.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Small populations are often exposed to high inbreeding and mutational load that can increase the risk of extinction. The Sumatran rhinoceros was widespread in Southeast Asia, but is now restricted to small and isolated populations on Sumatra and Borneo, and most likely extinct on the Malay Peninsula. Here, we analyse 5 historical and 16 modern genomes from these populations to investigate the genomic consequences of the recent decline, such as increased inbreeding and mutational load. We find that the Malay Peninsula population experienced increased inbreeding shortly before extirpation, which possibly was accompanied by purging. The populations on Sumatra and Borneo instead show low inbreeding, but high mutational load. The currently small population sizes may thus in the near future lead to inbreeding depression. Moreover, we find little evidence for differences in local adaptation among populations, suggesting that future inbreeding depression could potentially be mitigated by assisted gene flow among populations.},

Populations where large fish were selectively harvested (as in most fisheries) displayed substantial declines in fecundity, egg volume, larval size at hatch, larval viability, larval growth rates, food consumption rate and conversion efficiency, vertebral number, and willingness to forage. These genetically based changes in numerous traits generally reduce the capacity for population recovery.},

  abstract = {A multilocus stochastic model is developed to simulate the dynamics of mutational load in small  populations of various sizes. Old mutations sampled from a large ancestral population at  mutation--selection balance and new mutations arising each generation are considered jointly, using  biologically plausible lethal and deleterious mutation parameters. The results show that inbreeding  depression and the number of lethal equivalents due to partially recessive mutations can be partly  purged from the population by inbreeding, and that this purging mainly involves lethals or  detrimentals of large effect. However, fitness decreases continuously with inbreeding, due to  increased fixation and homozygosity of mildly deleterious mutants, resulting in extinctions of very  small populations with low reproductive rates. No optimum inbreeding rate or population size  exists for purging with respect to fitness (viability) changes, but there is an optimum inbreeding  rate at a given final level of inbreeding for reducing inbreeding depression or the number of lethal  equivalents. The interaction between selection against partially recessive mutations and genetic  drift in small populations also influences the rate of decay of neutral variation. Weak selection  against mutants relative to genetic drift results in apparent overdominance and thus an increase in  effective size (               N               e               ) at neutral loci, and strong selection relative to  drift leads to a decrease in               N               e               due  to the increased variance in family size. The simulation results and their implications are discussed  in the context of biological conservation and tests for purging.},

It is based on adding the same barcode sequence to subfragments of the original long DNA molecule (DNA cobarcoding). To achieve this efficiently, stLFR uses the surface of microbeads to create millions of miniaturized barcoding reactions in a single tube. Using a combinatorial process, up to 3.6 billion unique barcode sequences were generated on beads, enabling practically nonredundant cobarcoding with 50 million barcodes per sample. Using stLFR, we demonstrate efficient unique cobarcoding of more than 8 million 20- to 300-kb genomic DNA fragments. Analysis of the human genome NA12878 with stLFR demonstrated high-quality variant calling and phase block lengths up to N50 34 Mb. We also demonstrate detection of complex structural variants and complete diploid de novo assembly of NA12878. These analyses were all performed using single stLFR libraries, and their construction did not significantly add to the time or cost of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) library preparation. stLFR represents an easily automatable solution that enables high-quality sequencing, phasing, SV detection, scaffolding, cost-effective diploid de novo genome assembly, and other long DNA sequencing applications.},

Due to its rapid growth rate and short reproduction cycle, bay scallop possesses the highest annual yield in Chinese scallop production and serves as a good model species to study the genetic effects of population differentiation and selective breeding. Via whole genomic resequencing analysis of two artificially selective breeds (Haiyifeng12 and Zhongkehong) and a hatchery reference population (Jiaonan), we acquired a total of 3,885,213 high quality SNPs and 22,312 SSRs. A lower level of genomic polymorphism and increased linkage disequilibrium were detected in the two selective breeds compared with the hatchery reference population. Selective sweep analysis revealed that 104 and 223 genes are under selection in the two breeds respectively, which may be the causal factors for the improved performance in growth and immunity. Our study provides insight into the genetic differentiation and selection signatures of bay scallop selective breeds. Together with the generated genome wide SNP and SSR data, these findings are an important addition to the scallop genomic resources and have practical implications for breeding programs in scallop aquaculture.},

Such adaptive life-history traits often show strong local adaptation along environmental gradients but, despite their importance, the genetic architecture of these traits remains poorly understood. Results: We integrate whole genome re-sequencing with environmental and phenotypic data from common garden experiments to investigate the genomic basis of local adaptation across a latitudinal gradient in European aspen (Populus tremula). A single genomic region containing the PtFT2 gene mediates local adaptation in the timing of bud set and explains 65\% of the observed genetic variation in bud set. This locus is the likely target of a recent selective sweep that originated right before or during colonization of northern Scandinavia following the last glaciation. Field and greenhouse experiments confirm that variation in PtFT2 gene expression affects the phenotypic variation in bud set that we observe in wild natural populations. Conclusions: Our results reveal a major effect locus that determines the timing of bud set and that has facilitated rapid adaptation to shorter growing seasons and colder climates in European aspen. The discovery of a single locus explaining a substantial fraction of the variation in a key life-history trait is remarkable, given that such traits are generally considered to be highly polygenic. These findings provide a dramatic illustration of how loci of large-effect for adaptive traits can arise and be maintained over large geographical scales in natural populations.},

  abstract = {Individual inbreeding coefficient (F ) and pairwise relatedness (r) are fundamental parameters in population genetics and have important applications in diverse fields such as human medicine, forensics, plant and animal breeding, conservation and evolutionary biology. Traditionally, both parameters are calculated from pedigrees, but are now increasingly estimated from genetic marker data. Conceptually, a pedigree gives the expected F and r values, FP and rP , with the expectations being taken (hypothetically) over an infinite number of individuals with the same pedigree. In contrast, markers give the realised (actual) F and r values at the particular marker loci of the particular individuals, FM and rM . Both pedigree (FP , rP ) and marker (FM , rM ) estimates can be used as inferences of genomic inbreeding coefficients FG and genomic relatedness rG, which are the underlying quantities relevant to most applications (such as estimating inbreeding depression and heritability) of F and r. In the pre-genomic era, it was widely accepted that pedigrees are much better than markers in delineating FG and rG, and markers should better be used to validate, amend and construct pedigrees rather than to replace them. Is this still true in the genomic era when genome-wide dense SNPs are available? In this simulation study, I showed that genomic markers can yield much better estimates of FG and rG than pedigrees when they are numerous (say, 104 SNPs) under realistic situations (e.g. genome and population sizes). Pedigree estimates are especially poor for species with a small genome, where FG and rG are determined to a large extent by Mendelian segregations and may thus deviate substantially from their expectations (FP and rP ). Simulations also confirmed that FM , when estimated from many SNPs, can be much more powerful than FP for detecting inbreeding depression in viability. However, I argue that pedigrees cannot be replaced completely by genomic SNPs, because the former allows for the calculation of more complicated IBD coefficients (involving more than 2 individuals, more than one locus, and more than 2 genes at a locus) for which the latter may have reduced capacity or limited power, and because the former has social and other significance for remote relationships which have little genetic significance and cannot be inferred reliably from markers.},

Using these contigs and 15 794 length-filtered (greater than 200 bp) singletons, we identified 7762 transcripts that appear to be homologues of chicken genes. A specific BLAST search with an emphasis on immune genes found 308 homologous chicken genes that have immune function, including ten major histocompatibility complex-related genes located on chicken chromosome 16. We also identified 1300 expressed sequence tag microsatellites and were able to design suitable flanking primers for 526 of these. A preliminary test of the polymorphism of the microsatellites found 10 polymorphic microsatellites of the 102 tested.

  abstract = {Background: The different regions of a genome do not evolve at the same rate. For example, comparative genomic studies have suggested that the sex chromosomes and the regions harbouring the immune defence genes in the Major Histocompatability Complex (MHC) may evolve faster than other genomic regions. The advent of the next generation sequencing technologies has made it possible to study which genomic regions are evolutionary liable to change and which are static, as well as enabling an increasing number of genome studies of non-model species. However, de novo sequencing of the whole genome of an organism remains non-trivial. In this study, we present the draft genome of the black grouse, which was developed using a reference-guided assembly strategy. Results: We generated 133 Gbp of sequence data from one black grouse individual by the SOLiD platform and used a combination of de novo assembly and chicken reference genome mapping to assemble the reads into 4572 scaffolds with a total length of 1022 Mb. The draft genome well covers the main chicken chromosomes 1 {\textasciitilde} 28 and Z which have a total length of 1001 Mb. The draft genome is fragmented, but has a good coverage of the homologous chicken genes. Especially, 33.0\% of the coding regions of the homologous genes have more than 90\% proportion of their sequences covered. In addition, we identified {\textasciitilde}1 M SNPs from the genome and identified 106 genomic regions which had a high nucleotide divergence between black grouse and chicken or between black grouse and turkey. Conclusions: Our results support the hypothesis that the chromosome X (Z) evolves faster than the autosomes and our data are consistent with the MHC regions being more liable to change than the genome average. Our study demonstrates how a moderate sequencing effort can be combined with existing genome references to generate a draft genome for a non-model species.},

Also, managers typically only partially control harvest rates via changes to metrics such as season length and hunting party size, but the relationships between these proxies and harvest rate are often unknown. We studied a population of northern bobwhite Colinus virginianus over a three-year period to estimate harvest, survival and relationships between harvest rate and proxies of hunting pressure. We captured and marked bobwhite with only bands (n\,=\,479) or bands and radio-transmitters (n\,=\,592). We monitored radio-marked individuals weekly until radio failure, lost signal or death. A comparison of annual survival rates indicated birds marked with only bands survived at similar rates (14.5\%, 95\% CI: 7.6, 21.4\%) compared to those marked with both bands and radio-transmitters (10.6\%, 95\% CI: 7.9, 13.3\%). A cumulative incidence function for cause-specific mortality produced an annual harvest rate estimate of 12.0\% (95\% CI: 8.6, 15.4\%). However, this estimate was likely negatively biased in the presence of undocumented crippling loss. We also derived a 14.4\% annual harvest rate using average observed levels of hunting pressure and a joint live--dead model that was not dependent on classification of mortality sources. We predicted annual harvest rates over a range of population sizes and hunting pressures to inform managers of possible thresholds to target. Hunting pressure was an important predictor of harvest rate. For instance, we estimated that adding approximately two more hunters per week would push seasonal harvest rates past the targeted harvest threshold, indicating managers should carefully regulate hunting pressure to avoid exceeding set harvest limits. Estimating relationships between weekly survival and hunting pressure can provide information to evaluate different management scenarios and help develop hunting regulations.},

First-year survival rates differed between years, but in each year were highest in late autumn prior to dispersal, when predation by stoats Mustela erminea and raptors accounted for three-quarters of deaths. First-year grouse survival was lower than that of adult birds owing to predation in the autumn and winter by raptors and stoats. The annual adult survival rate of 0.72 was higher than those found in most other European studies. By contrast, breeding success was low. Dispersal was confined to first-year hens, with distinct dispersal periods in late autumn (mean 10.3 km) and again in early spring (mean 5.8 km). Natal dispersal resulted in none of the first-year hens breeding within the study area. Adults of either sex and first-year cocks showed high site fidelity.

It considers the technological principles upon which PLF is based, gives several examples of PLF, considers which livestock processes are suitable for the PLF approach, addresses whether PLF constitutes technology push or market pull, and stresses the need for a prospective bioethical analysis of PLF. We conclude that PLF is an embryonic technology with great promise but one that requires considerable research and development before uptake. {\copyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Among callitrichids, adult males have been implicated in driving group reproductive output, but uneven sampling efforts, the underlying effects of group size, and pseudoreplication at the group and species levels are confounding variables in these analyses. We examined the drivers of group reproductive output in callitrichids by 1) conducting a meta-analysis of published studies of callitrichid group composition; 2) assigning developmental class based on reproductive morphology; and 3) using multivariate modeling to test whether the proportion of individuals of each developmental class predicts the presence and the number of surviving offspring among free-ranging Weddell's saddleback tamarins (Leontocebus weddelli) and emperor tamarins (Saguinus imperator) in Peru. The meta-analysis revealed that the number of adult females and group size, but not the number of adult males, are significantly correlated with group reproductive output. Statistical models of the new dataset revealed that the proportion of primary breeding males, primary breeding females, and group size predicted whether groups had surviving infants, and that only the proportion of primary breeding females and group size predicted the number of surviving infants. Thus, primary breeding males appear to be necessary for groups to raise any infants, but a higher proportion of primary breeding females and a larger group size increase group reproductive output overall.},

  abstract = {DNA methylation could shape phenotypic responses to environmental cues and underlie developmental plasticity. Environmentally induced changes in DNA methylation during development can give rise to stable phenotypic traits and thus affect fitness. In the laboratory, it has been shown that the vertebrate methylome undergoes dynamic reprogramming during development, creating a critical window for environmentally induced epigenetic modifications. Studies of DNA methylation in the wild are lacking, yet are essential for understanding how genes and the environment interact to affect phenotypic development and ultimately fitness. Furthermore, our knowledge of the establishment of methylation patterns during development in birds is limited. We quantified genome-wide DNA methylation at various stages of embryonic and postnatal development in an altricial passerine bird, the great tit Parus major. While, there was no change in global DNA methylation in embryonic tissue during the second half of embryonic development, a twofold increase in DNA methylation in blood occurred between 6 and 15~days posthatch. Though not directly comparable, DNA methylation levels were higher in the blood of nestlings compared with embryonic tissue at any stage of prenatal development. This provides the first evidence that DNA methylation undergoes global change during development in a wild bird, supporting the hypothesis that methylation mediates phenotypic development. Furthermore, the plasticity of DNA methylation demonstrated during late postnatal development, in the present study, suggests a wide window during which DNA methylation could be sensitive to environmental influences. This is particularly important for our understanding of the mechanisms by which early-life conditions influence later-life performance. While, we found no evidence for differences in genome-wide methylation in relation to habitat of origin, environmental variation is likely to be an important driver of variation in methylation at specific loci.},

Twelve multiparous Holstein cows and twelve multiparous Jersey cows were intravenously infused daily for approximately 7 days prepartum with either saline or 1.0mg/kg bodyweight of the immediate precursor to serotonin synthesis, 5hydroxy- l -tryptophan (5-HTP). On infusion days, blood was collected before, after, and at 2, 4, and 8h postinfusion. Blood and urine were collected daily before the infusion period, for 14 days postpartum and on day 30 postpartum. Milk was collected daily during the postpartum period. Feed intake and milk yield were unaffected by 5-HTP infusion postpartum. Cows infused with 5-HTP had elevated circulating serotonin concentrations prepartum. Infusion with 5-HTP induced a transient hypocalcemia in Jersey cows prepartum, but not in any other treatment. Holstein cows infused with saline had the highest milk calcium on the day of and day after parturition. Postpartum, circulating total calcium tended to be elevated, and urine deoxypyridinoline (DPD) concentrations were elevated in Holstein cows infused with 5-HTP. Overall, Jerseys had higher urine DPD concentrations postpartum when compared with Holsteins. Taken together, these data warrant further investigation of the potential therapeutic benefit of 5-HTP administration prepartum for prevention of hypocalcemia. Further research should focus on delineation of mechanisms associated with 5-HTP infusion that control calcium homeostasis during the peripartum period in Holstein and Jersey cows.},

In several social mammals, mothers continue to improve the survival of their offspring well into adulthood;1--5 however, whether this extended care comes at a reproductive costs to mothers, and therefore represents maternal investment, is not well understood. We tested whether lifetime maternal care is a form of parental investment in fish-eating ``resident'' killer whales. Adult killer whales, particularly males, are known to receive survival benefits from their mothers;3 however, whether this comes at a cost to mothers' reproductive success is not known. Using multiple decades of complete census data from the ``southern resident'' population, we found a strong negative correlation between females' number of surviving weaned sons and their annual probability of producing a viable calf. This negative effect did not attenuate as sons grew older, and the cost of sons could not be explained by long-term costs of lactation or group composition effects, supporting the hypothesis that caring for adult sons is reproductively costly. This is the first direct evidence of lifetime maternal investment in an iteroparous animal, revealing a previously unknown life history strategy.},

  abstract = {In order to assess the significance of local adaptation relative to environmental plasticity on the evolution of life history traits, we analysed the possible genetic basis of differences between pond- and stream-breeding fire salamanders (Salamandra salamandra) in Germany. These salamanders typically deposit their larvae in small streams, where they grow until they are sufficiently large to metamorphose. However, some populations in Western Germany use ponds as larval habitat. Because habitat quality of streams differs from that of ponds one expects life history differences in the pond animals, which may result either from a plastic response or through genetic differentiation (i.e. local adaptation). Using a phylogeographical analysis of mitochondrial D-loop sequences, we show that both stream and pond populations in Western Germany are derived from a single lineage that recolonized following the last glaciation. This finding suggests that pond breeding originated very recently. Our studies of habitat quality and metamorphic behaviour of larvae in natural ponds and streams disclosed that pond larvae experience a significantly reduced food supply and greater risk of drying than do stream larvae. Pond larvae metamorphose earlier at the cost of reduced mass. Common-environment experiments with pond and stream larvae show that metamorphic behaviour of pond larvae under limited-food conditions is determined genetically and is not simply a plastic response to the differing habitat conditions. These results show that phenotypic plasticity is less important than local adaptation in explaining differences in ecological diversification within this species and suggests the possibility of rapid evolution of genetic adaptations when new habitats are exploited.},

However, despite a fundamental role in fitness, we have a limited understanding of the cues that individuals use to assess inbreeding risk, as well as the extent to which individual inbreeding behavior is repeatable. We used piecewise structural equation modeling of 24 years of data to investigate the causes and consequences of within- versus extra-group paternity in banded mongooses. This cooperatively breeding mammal lives in tight-knit social groups that often contain closely related opposite-sex breeders, so inbreeding can be avoided through extra-group mating. We used molecular parentage assignments to show that, despite extra-group paternity resulting in outbred offspring, within-group inbreeding occurs frequently, with around 16\% litters being moderately or highly inbred. Additionally, extra-group paternity appears to be plastic, with females mating outside of their social group according to individual proxies (age and immigration status) and societal proxies (group size and age) of within-group inbreeding risk but not in direct response to levels of within-group relatedness. While individual repeatability in extra-group paternity was relatively low, female cobreeders showed high repeatability, suggesting a strong constraint arising from the opportunities for extra-group mating. The use of extra-group paternity as an inbreeding avoidance strategy is, therefore, limited by high costs, opportunity constraints, and the limited reliability of proxies of inbreeding risk.},

  abstract = {Bayesian data analysis is increasingly used in ecology, but prior specification remains focused on choosing non-informative priors (e.g., flat or vague priors). One barrier to choosing more informative priors is that priors must be specified on model parameters (e.g., intercepts, slopes, and sigmas), but prior knowledge often exists on the level of the response variable. This is particularly true for common models in ecology, like generalized linear mixed models that have a link function and potentially dozens of parameters, each of which needs a prior distribution. We suggest that this difficulty can be overcome by simulating from the prior predictive distribution and visualizing the results on the scale of the response variable. In doing so, some common choices for non-informative priors on parameters can easily be seen to produce biologically impossible values of response variables. Such implications of prior choices are difficult to foresee without visualization. We demonstrate a workflow for prior selection using simulation and visualization with two ecological examples (predator--prey body sizes and spider responses to food competition). This approach is not new, but its adoption by ecologists will help to better incorporate prior information in ecological models, thereby maximizing one of the benefits of Bayesian data analysis.},

  abstract = {Inbreeding (reproduction between relatives) often decreases the fitness of offspring and is thus expected to lead to the evolution of inbreeding avoidance strategies. Chimpanzees (               Pan troglodytes               ) are expected to avoid inbreeding as they are long-lived, invest heavily in offspring and may encounter adult, opposite sex kin frequently, especially in populations where both males and females commonly remain in the group in which they were born (bisexual philopatry). However, it is unclear whether substantial bisexual philopatry has been a feature of chimpanzees' evolutionary history or whether it is a result of recent anthropogenic interference, as the only groups for which it has been documented are significantly impacted by human encroachment and experience notable rates of potentially unsustainable inbreeding. Here we use 14 years of observational data and a large genomic dataset of 256 481 loci sequenced from 459 individuals to document dispersal and inbreeding dynamics in an eastern chimpanzee (               P. t. schweinfurthii               ) community with low levels of anthropogenic disturbance. We document the first case of substantial bisexual philopatry in a relatively undisturbed chimpanzee community and show that, despite an increased inbreeding risk incurred by females who do not disperse before reaching reproductive age, natal females were still able to avoid producing inbred offspring.},

  abstract = {Gene set enrichment tests (a.k.a. functional enrichment analysis) are among the most frequently used methods in computational biology. Despite this popularity, there are concerns that these methods are being applied incorrectly and the results of some peer-reviewed publications are unreliable. These problems include the use of inappropriate background gene lists, lack of false discovery rate correction and lack of methodological detail. To ascertain the frequency of these issues in the literature, we performed a screen of 186 open-access research articles describing functional enrichment results. We find that 95\% of analyses using over-representation tests did not implement an appropriate background gene list or did not describe this in the methods. Failure to perform p-value correction for multiple tests was identified in 43\% of analyses. Many studies lacked detail in the methods section about the tools and gene sets used. An extension of this survey showed that these problems are not associated with journal or article level bibliometrics. Using seven independent RNA-seq datasets, we show misuse of enrichment tools alters results substantially. In conclusion, most published functional enrichment studies suffered from one or more major flaws, highlighting the need for stronger standards for enrichment analysis.},

The quantification and analysis of body condition indices has been the subject of debate for decades. Here, we summarize three additional concerns with the use of body condition indices.                                                     First, body condition index is often poorly correlated with lipid content in animals. Second, even if body condition index and lipid content are correlated, lipid content of an animal may not be the most important aspect of body composition influencing fitness. Finally, neither body condition index nor lipid reserves are likely to be directly positively related to fitness in animals, as many animals homeostatically regulate intermediate levels of condition index or lipid reserves, with both higher and lower values incurring fitness costs.                                                     A wide range of analytical methods, including some relatively inexpensive and simple measures, are available for more detailed measures of animal body composition or fitness-related traits. Replacing body condition indices with more direct measures of body composition -- even relatively simple measures -- can inform understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying animal responses in a wide range of behavioural, ecological and evolutionary studies.},

  abstract = {Sexual selection drives fundamental evolutionary processes such as trait elaboration and speciation. Despite this importance, there are surprisingly few examples of genes unequivocally responsible for variation in sexually selected phenotypes. This lack of information inhibits our ability to predict phenotypic change due to universal behaviours, such as fighting over mates and mate choice. Here, we discuss reasons for this apparent gap and provide recommendations for how it can be overcome by adopting contemporary genomic methods, exploiting underutilized taxa that may be ideal for detecting the effects of sexual selection and adopting appropriate experimental paradigms. Identifying genes that determine variation in sexually selected traits has the potential to improve theoretical models and reveal whether the genetic changes underlying phenotypic novelty utilize common or unique molecular mechanisms. Such a genomic approach to sexual selection will help answer questions in the evolution of sexually selected phenotypes that were first asked by Darwin and can furthermore serve as a model for the application of genomics in all areas of evolutionary biology.},

  abstract = {A new Bayesian method that uses individual multilocus genotypes to estimate rates of recent immigration (over the last several generations) among populations is presented. The method also estimates the posterior probability distributions of individual immigrant ancestries, population allele frequencies, population inbreeding coefficients, and other parameters of potential interest. The method is implemented in a computer program that relies on Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques to carry out the estimation of posterior probabilities. The program can be used with allozyme, microsatellite, RFLP, SNP, and other kinds of genotype data. We relax several assumptions of early methods for detecting recent immigrants, using genotype data; most significantly, we allow genotype frequencies to deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium proportions within populations. The program is demonstrated by applying it to two recently published microsatellite data sets for populations of the plant species Centaurea corymbosa and the gray wolf species Canis lupus. A computer simulation study suggests that the program can provide highly accurate estimates of migration rates and individual migrant ancestries, given sufficient genetic differentiation among populations and sufficient numbers of marker loci.},

  abstract = {1. Efforts to understand the links between evolutionary and ecological dynamics hinge on our ability to measure and understand how genes influence phenotypes, fitness and population dynamics. Quantitative genetics provides a range of theoretical and empirical tools with which to achieve this when the relatedness between individuals within a population is known. 2. A number of recent studies have used a type of mixed-effects model, known as the animal model, to estimate the genetic component of phenotypic variation using data collected in the field. Here, we provide a practical guide for ecologists interested in exploring the potential to apply this quantitative genetic method in their research. 3. We begin by outlining, in simple terms, key concepts in quantitative genetics and how an animal model estimates relevant quantitative genetic parameters, such as heritabilities or genetic correlations. 4. We then provide three detailed example tutorials, for implementation in a variety of software packages, for some basic applications of the animal model. We discuss several important statistical issues relating to best practice when fitting different kinds of mixed models. 5. We conclude by briefly summarizing more complex applications of the animal model, and by highlighting key pitfalls and dangers for the researcher wanting to begin using quantitative genetic tools to address ecological and evolutionary questions. {\copyright} 2009 British Ecological Society.},

The aims of this symposium were to address current research in the personality field, spanning both behavioral ecology and psychology, to highlight the future directions for this research, and to consider whether differential approaches to studying behavior contribute something new to the understanding of animal behavior. In this paper, we discuss the study of endocrinology and ontogeny in understanding how behavioral variation is generated and maintained, despite selection pressures assumed to reduce this variation. We consider the potential mechanisms that could link certain traits to fitness outcomes through longevity and cognition. We also address the role of individual differences in stress coping, mortality, and health risk, and how the study of these relationships could be applied to improve animal welfare. From the insights provided by these topics, we assert that studying individual differences through the lens of personality has provided new directions in behavioral research, and we encourage further research in these directions, across this interdisciplinary field.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Survival of adult individuals is a key demographic parameter, that is critical for conservation programs of species and evolutionary research focused on life-history traits. Here, we present the estimates of the apparent annual survival of lekking male Great Snipes of the lowland population, breeding in wet meadow habitats in the valley of the Pripyat River. We also investigate individual traits such as body size and body condition, that may influence birds' survival. The annual apparent survival in the studied population was low ({$\Phi$} (.)\,=\,0.43), but no change in this parameter was found over the period of 22~years. The chances for survival increased with the body size of an individual. We hypothesize that smaller individuals with shorter bills might face limited foraging options compared to larger birds, which may result in insufficient nutrition during challenging life cycle events such as moulting of primaries combined with preparation for long-distance migration conducted in one non-stop flight. Additionally, the presented results indicate that the wet meadow in the Pripyat River Valley provides suitable breeding habitat for this species with sufficient conservation practices held there, and the low annual apparent survival is probably a life-history trait of this species resulting from a ``high pace of life'' and elevated metabolic rate. To our knowledge, this study provides the first estimates of the long-term population characteristic for the eastern, lowland population of this species, which could prove helpful in the assessment of population viability for this globally declining species.           ,              Zusammenfassung                            In {\"o}stlichen Tieflandpopulationen beeinflusst die K{\"o}rpergr{\"o}{\ss}e die j{\"a}hrliche {\"U}berlebensrate areana-balzender Doppelschnepfen               (                                Gallinago media                              )                          Das {\"U}berleben adulter Tiere ist ein wichtiger demografischer Parameter, der f{\"u}r Artenschutzprogramme und f{\"u}r die Evolutionsforschung speziell zu Eigenschaften {\"u}ber die gesamte Lebenszeit hinweg von entscheidender Bedeutung ist.

  abstract = {The methyltransferase-like (METTL) proteins constitute a family of seven-beta-strand methyltransferases with S-adenosyl methionine-binding domains that modify DNA, RNA, and proteins. Methylation by METTL proteins contributes to the epigenetic, and in the case of RNA modifications, epitranscriptomic regulation of a variety of biological processes. Despite their functional importance, most investigations of the substrates and functions of METTLs within metazoans have been restricted to model vertebrate taxa. In the present work, we explore the evolutionary mechanisms driving the diversification and functional differentiation of 33 individual METTL proteins across Metazoa. Our results show that METTLs are nearly ubiquitous across the animal kingdom, with most having arisen early in metazoan evolution (i.e., occur in basal metazoan phyla). Individual METTL lineages each originated from single independent ancestors, constituting monophyletic clades, which suggests that each METTL was subject to strong selective constraints driving its structural and/or functional specialization. Interestingly, a similar process did not extend to the differentiation of nucleoside-modifying and protein-modifying METTLs (i.e., each METTL type did not form a unique monophyletic clade). The members of these two types of METTLs also exhibited differences in their rates of evolution. Overall, we provide evidence that the long-term evolution of METTL family members was driven by strong purifying selection, which in combination with adaptive selection episodes, led to the functional specialization of individual METTL lineages. This work contributes useful information regarding the evolution of a gene family that fulfills a variety of epigenetic functions, and can have profound influences on molecular processes and phenotypic traits.},

Here we examined whether deficiency of a de novo DNA methyltransferase, Dnmt3a, affects in vitro differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) to neuronal and glial cell lineages. Early-passage neural stem cells (NSCs) derived from Dnmt3a-deficient ESCs exhibited a moderate phenotype in precocious glial differentiation compared with wild-type counterparts. However, successive passaging to passage 6 (P6), when wild-type NSCs become gliogenic, revealed a robust phenotype of precocious astrocyte and oligodendrocyte differentiation in Dnmt3a-/- NSCs, consistent with our previous findings in the more severely hypomethylated Dnmt1-/- NSCs. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that total levels of methylcytosine in Dnmt3a-/- NSCs at P6 were globally hypomethylated. Moreover, the Dnmt3a-/- NSC proliferation rate was significantly increased compared with control from P6 onward. Thus, our work revealed a novel role for Dnmt3a in regulating both the timing of neural cell differentiation and the cell proliferation in the paradigm of mESC-derived-NSCs. {\copyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

RNA-seq can be used for a variety of applications, however, identifying differential expression (DE) remains a key task in functional genomics. There have been a number of statistical methods for DE detection for RNA-seq data. One common feature of several leading methods is the use of the negative binomial (Gamma--Poisson mixture) model. That is, the unobserved gene expression is modeled by a gamma random variable and, given the expression, the sequencing read counts are modeled as Poisson. The distinct feature in various methods is how the variance, or dispersion, in the Gamma distribution is modeled and estimated. We evaluate several large public RNA-seq datasets and find that the estimated dispersion in existing methods does not adequately capture the heterogeneity of biological variance among samples. We present a new empirical Bayes shrinkage estimate of the dispersion parameters and demonstrate improved DE detection.},

  abstract = {Background: DNA methylation, which mainly occurs at CpG dinucleotides, is a dynamic epigenetic regulation mechanism in most eukaryotic genomes. It is already known that methylated CpG dinucleotides can lead to a high rate of C to T mutation at these sites. However, less is known about whether and how the methylation level causes a different mutation rate, especially at the single-base resolution. Results: In this study, we used genome-wide single-base resolution methylation data to perform a comprehensive analysis of the mutation rate of methylated cytosines from human embryonic stem cell. Through the analysis of the density of single nucleotide polymorphisms, we first confirmed that the mutation rate in methylated CpG sites is greater than that in unmethylated CpG sites. Then, we showed that among methylated CpG sites, the mutation rate is markedly increased in low-intermediately (20-40\% methylation level) to intermediately methylated CpG sites (40-60\% methylation level) of the human genome. This mutation pattern was observed regardless of DNA strand direction and the sequence coverage over the site on which the methylation level was calculated. Moreover, this highly non-random mutation pattern was found more apparent in intergenic and intronic regions than in promoter regions and CpG islands. Our investigation suggested this pattern appears primarily in autosomes rather than sex chromosomes. Further analysis based on human-chimpanzee divergence confirmed these observations. Finally, we observed a significant correlation between the methylation level and cytosine allele frequency. Conclusions: Our results showed a high mutation rate in low-intermediately to intermediately methylated CpG sites at different scales, from the categorized genomic region, whole chromosome, to the whole genome level, thereby providing the first supporting evidence of mutation rate variation at human methylated CpG sites using the genome-wide sing-base resolution methylation data.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The purging of deleterious alleles has been hypothesized to mitigate inbreeding depression, but its effectiveness in endangered species remains debatable. To understand how deleterious alleles are purged during population contractions, we analyzed genomes of the endangered Chinese crocodile lizard (Shinisaurus crocodilurus), which is the only surviving species of its family and currently isolated into small populations. Population genomic analyses revealed four genetically distinct conservation units and sharp declines in both effective population size and genetic diversity. By comparing the relative genetic load across populations and conducting genomic simulations, we discovered that seriously deleterious alleles were effectively purged during population contractions in this relict species, although inbreeding generally enhanced the genetic burden. However, despite with the initial purging, our simulations also predicted that seriously deleterious alleles will gradually accumulate under prolonged bottlenecking. Therefore, we emphasize the importance of maintaining a minimum population capacity and increasing the functional genetic diversity in conservation efforts to preserve populations of the crocodile lizard and other endangered species.},

  abstract = {Predicting defects in RNA splicing                            Most eukaryotic messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are spliced to remove introns. Splicing generates uninterrupted open reading frames that can be translated into proteins. Splicing is often highly regulated, generating alternative spliced forms that code for variant proteins in different tissues. RNA-binding proteins that bind specific sequences in the mRNA regulate splicing. Xiong               et al.               develop a computational model that predicts splicing regulation for any mRNA sequence (see the Perspective by Guig{\'o} and Valc{\'a}rcel). They use this to analyze more than half a million mRNA splicing sequence variants in the human genome. They are able to identify thousands of known disease-causing mutations, as well as many new disease candidates, including 17 new autism-linked genes.

We developed a computational technique that scores how strongly genetic variants affect RNA splicing, a critical step in gene expression whose disruption contributes to many diseases, including cancers and neurological disorders. A genome-wide analysis reveals tens of thousands of variants that alter splicing and are enriched with a wide range of known diseases. Our results provide insight into the genetic basis of spinal muscular atrophy, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, and autism spectrum disorder.                                         RATIONALE               We used ``deep learning'' computer algorithms to derive a computational model that takes as input DNA sequences and applies general rules to predict splicing in human tissues. Given a test variant, which may be up to 300 nucleotides into an intron, our model can be used to compute a score for how much the variant alters splicing. The model is not biased by existing disease annotations or population data and was derived in such a way that it can be used to study diverse diseases and disorders and to determine the consequences of common, rare, and even spontaneous variants.                                         RESULTS               Our technique is able to accurately classify disease-causing variants and provides insights into the role of aberrant splicing in disease. We scored more than 650,000 DNA variants and found that disease-causing variants have higher scores than common variants and even those associated with disease in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Our model predicts substantial and unexpected aberrant splicing due to variants within introns and exons, including those far from the splice site. For example, among intronic variants that are more than 30 nucleotides away from any splice site, known disease variants alter splicing nine times as often as common variants; among missense exonic disease variants, those that least affect protein function are more than five times as likely as other variants to alter splicing.               Autism has been associated with disrupted splicing in brain regions, so we used our method to score variants detected using whole-genome sequencing data from individuals with and without autism. Genes with high-scoring variants include many that have previously been linked with autism, as well as new genes with known neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Most of the high-scoring variants are intronic and cannot be detected by exome analysis techniques.               When we scored clinical variants in spinal muscular atrophy and colorectal cancer genes, up to 94\% of variants found to alter splicing using minigene reporters were correctly classified.                                         CONCLUSION               In the context of precision medicine, causal support for variants independent of existing whole-genome variant studies is greatly needed. Our computational model was trained to predict splicing from DNA sequence alone, without using disease annotations or population data. Consequently, its predictions are independent of and complementary to population data, GWAS, expression-based quantitative trait loci (QTL), and functional annotations of the genome. As such, our technique greatly expands the opportunities for understanding the genetic determinants of disease.                                                   ``Deep learning'' reveals the genetic origins of disease.                   A computational system mimics the biology of RNA splicing by correlating DNA elements with splicing levels in healthy human tissues. The system can scan DNA and identify damaging genetic variants, including those deep within introns. This procedure has led to insights into the genetics of autism, cancers, and spinal muscular atrophy.                                                                         ,              To facilitate precision medicine and whole-genome annotation, we developed a machine-learning technique that scores how strongly genetic variants affect RNA splicing, whose alteration contributes to many diseases. Analysis of more than 650,000 intronic and exonic variants revealed widespread patterns of mutation-driven aberrant splicing. Intronic disease mutations that are more than 30 nucleotides from any splice site alter splicing nine times as often as common variants, and missense exonic disease mutations that have the least impact on protein function are five times as likely as others to alter splicing. We detected tens of thousands of disease-causing mutations, including those involved in cancers and spinal muscular atrophy. Examination of intronic and exonic variants found using whole-genome sequencing of individuals with autism revealed misspliced genes with neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Our approach provides evidence for causal variants and should enable new discoveries in precision medicine.},

We found that the two eastern subspecies have experienced a prolonged population decline over the past 100,000 years, resulting in very low genetic diversity and an increased overall burden of deleterious variation. A further recent decline in the mountain gorilla population has led to extensive inbreeding, such that individuals are typically homozygous at 34\% of their sequence, leading to the purging of severely deleterious recessive mutations from the population. We discuss the causes of their decline and the consequences for their future survival.},

  abstract = {Major evolutionary transitions are enigmas, and the most notable enigma is between invertebrates and vertebrates, with numerous spectacular innovations. To search for the molecular connections involved, we asked whether global epigenetic changes may offer a clue by surveying the inheritance and reprogramming of parental DNA methylation across metazoans. We focused on gametes and early embryos, where the methylomes are known to evolve divergently between fish and mammals. Here, we find that methylome reprogramming during embryogenesis occurs neither in pre-bilaterians such as cnidarians nor in protostomes such as insects, but clearly presents in deuterostomes such as echinoderms and invertebrate chordates, and then becomes more evident in vertebrates. Functional association analysis suggests that DNA methylation reprogramming is associated with development, reproduction and adaptive immunity for vertebrates, but not for invertebrates. Interestingly, the single HOX cluster of invertebrates maintains unmethylated status in all stages examined. In contrast, the multiple HOX clusters show dramatic dynamics of DNA methylation during vertebrate embryogenesis. Notably, the methylation dynamics of HOX clusters are associated with their spatiotemporal expression in mammals. Our study reveals that DNA methylation reprogramming has evolved dramatically during animal evolution, especially after the evolutionary transitions from invertebrates to vertebrates, and then to mammals.},

  abstract = {Significance             Intergenerational epigenetic inheritance is usually considered to be of minor significance in mammals because the epigenome is reprogrammed twice between each generation. Yet whether this paradigm holds in nonmammalian organisms is largely unknown. Here, we show that epigenetic marks are transferred across generations in an invertebrate, the honey bee. We found that the epigenome is much more similar between fathers and daughters than between unrelated males and females of different generations within each colony. Epigenetic marks are not only conserved across generations, but also across somatic and germline tissues. Epigenetic reprogramming may thus be a mammalian-specific feature, suggesting a heightened capacity for epigenetic marks to influence evolutionary adaptation across the tree of life.           ,              The evolutionary significance of epigenetic inheritance is controversial. While epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation can affect gene function and change in response to environmental conditions, their role as carriers of heritable information is often considered anecdotal. Indeed, near-complete DNA methylation reprogramming, as occurs during mammalian embryogenesis, is a major hindrance for the transmission of nongenetic information between generations. Yet it remains unclear how general DNA methylation reprogramming is across the tree of life. Here we investigate the existence of epigenetic inheritance in the honey bee. We studied whether fathers can transfer epigenetic information to their daughters through DNA methylation. We performed instrumental inseminations of queens, each with four different males, retaining half of each male's semen for whole genome bisulfite sequencing. We then compared the methylation profile of each father's somatic tissue and semen with the methylation profile of his daughters. We found that DNA methylation patterns were highly conserved between tissues and generations. There was a much greater similarity of methylomes within patrilines (i.e., father-daughter subfamilies) than between patrilines in each colony. Indeed, the samples' methylomes consistently clustered by patriline within colony. Samples from the same patriline had twice as many shared methylated sites and four times fewer differentially methylated regions compared to samples from different patrilines. Our findings indicate that there is no DNA methylation reprogramming in bees and, consequently, that DNA methylation marks are stably transferred between generations. This points to a greater evolutionary potential of the epigenome in invertebrates than there is in mammals.},

Performing genomic scaffolding using Hi-\-C data is highly resource-\-demanding and employs elaborate laboratory steps for sample preparation. It starts with building a primary genome sequence assembly as an input, which is followed by computation for genome scaffolding using Hi-\-C data, requiring careful validation.

This phenomenon can be quantified from SNP data through a number of measures of inbreeding. Our study addresses two key questions. How accurate are the different methods to estimate ID? And how and why should investigators choose among the multiple inbreeding measures to detect and quantify ID? Here, we compare the behaviors of ID estimates from three commonly used SNP-based measures of inbreeding and provide both theoretical and empirical arguments to answer these questions.

After 5 years of continual development, ggtree has been evolved as a package suite that contains treeio for tree data input and output, tidytree for tree data manipulation, and ggtree for tree data visualization. Ggtree was originally designed to work with phylogenetic trees, and has been expanded to support other tree-like structures, which extends the application of ggtree to present tree data in other disciplines. This article contains five basic protocols describing how to visualize trees using the grammar of graphics syntax, how to visualize hierarchical clustering results with associated data, how to estimate bootstrap values and visualize the values on the tree, how to estimate continuous and discrete ancestral traits and visualize ancestral states on the tree, and how to visualize a multiple sequence alignment with a phylogenetic tree.

Yet, how the sources variance these traits can be decomposed remains unclear. Moreover, whether genetic correlations with life-history traits, personality traits and other phenotypic traits exist as predicted by the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis remains poorly understood. Our aim was to compare the heritability of personality, life-history and morphological traits and their potential genetic correlations in a small primate (               Microcebus murinus               ). We performed an animal model analysis on six traits measured in a large sample of captive mouse lemurs (               N               = 486). We chose two personality traits, two life-history traits and two morphological traits to (i) estimate the genetic and/or environmental contribution to their variance, and (ii) test for genetic correlations between these traits. We found modest narrow-sense heritability for personality traits, morphological traits and life-history traits. Other factors including maternal effects also influence the sources of variation in life-history and morphological traits. We found genetic correlations between emergence latency on the one hand and radius length and growth rate on the other hand. Emergence latency was also genetically correlated with birth weight and was influenced by maternal identity. These results provide insights into the influence of genes and maternal effects on the partitioning of sources of variation in personality, life-history and morphological traits in a captive primate model and suggest that the pace-of-life syndrome may be partly explained by genetic trait covariances.},

However, such systems typically do not detect the biomarkers present in sweat, and thus do not take advantage of the biological information in the sweat. Likewise, such systems do not detect the volatile organic components (VOC's) created under stressful conditions. This work presents a review into the current status of human emotional stress biomarkers and proposes the major potential biomarkers for future wearable sensors in affective systems. Emotional stress has been classified as a major contributor in several social problems, related to crime, health, the economy, and indeed quality of life. While blood cortisol tests, electroencephalography and physiological parameter methods are the gold standards for measuring stress; however, they are typically invasive or inconvenient and not suitable for wearable real-time stress monitoring. Alternatively, cortisol in biofluids and VOCs emitted from the skin appear to be practical and useful markers for sensors to detect emotional stress events. This work has identified antistress hormones and cortisol metabolites as the primary stress biomarkers that can be used in future sensors for wearable affective systems.},

The data suggest that land plants and vertebrates, which have extensive DNA methylation, are under strong selective pressure to repress TEs, because of their sexual mode of reproduction. Unicellular animals and fungi that reproduce asexually are more likely to lose TE methylation. Although gene body methylation is evolutionarily ancient, it is also mutagenic, and so loss of this pathway has been relatively common and occurred early in fungal evolution and later in several plant and animal lineages.                        ,              Analysis of DNA methylation in 17 species suggests a path for the evolution of this epigenetic mark.           ,              Eukaryotic cytosine methylation represses transcription but also occurs in the bodies of active genes, and the extent of methylation biology conservation is unclear. We quantified DNA methylation in 17 eukaryotic genomes and found that gene body methylation is conserved between plants and animals, whereas selective methylation of transposons is not. We show that methylation of plant transposons in the CHG context extends to green algae and that exclusion of histone H2A.Z from methylated DNA is conserved between plants and animals, and we present evidence for RNA-directed DNA methylation of fungal genes. Our data demonstrate that extant DNA methylation systems are mosaics of conserved and derived features, and indicate that gene body methylation is an ancient property of eukaryotic genomes.},

  abstract = {We have observed extensive interindividual differences in DNA methylation of 8590 CpG sites of 6229 genes in 153 human adult cerebellum samples, enriched in CpG island ``shores'' and at further distances from CpG islands. To search for genetic factors that regulate this variation, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) mapping of methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) for the 8590 testable CpG sites. cis association refers to correlation of methylation with SNPs within 1 Mb of a CpG site. 736 CpG sites showed phenotype-wide significant cis association with 2878 SNPs (after permutation correction for all tested markers and methylation phenotypes). In trans analysis of methylation, which tests for distant regulation effects, associations of 12 CpG sites and 38 SNPs remained significant after phenotype-wide correction. To examine the functional effects of mQTLs, we analyzed 85 genes that were with genetically regulated methylation we observed and for which we had quality gene expression data. Ten genes showed SNP-methylation-expression three-way associations---the same SNP simultaneously showed significant association with both DNA methylation and gene expression, while DNA methylation was significantly correlated with gene expression. Thus, we demonstrated that DNA methylation is frequently a heritable continuous quantitatively variable trait in human brain. Unlike allele-specific methylation, genetic polymorphisms mark both cis- and trans-regulatory genetic sites at measurable distances from their CpG sites. Some of the genetically regulated DNA methylation is directly connected with genetically regulated gene expression variation.},

However, global reprogramming during offspring embryogenesis and gametogenesis represents the largest hurdle to conceptualize it. Yet, detailed characterization of how sperm epigenetic alterations carrying ``environmental memory'' can evade offspring embryonic reprogramming remains elusive. Here, mice exposed to long-term restraint stress were employed to study the mechanisms underlying inter- and transgenerational effects of paternal exposure to a long-term psychological stress. We found that stress could induce paternal inheritance of reproductive, behavioral, and metabolic disorders. Bisulfite methylation profiling of 18 sperm and 12 embryo samples of three consecutive generations identified inter- and transgenerational inheritance of paternal Differential DNA Methylation Regions (DMRs) at frequencies {\textasciitilde}11.36\% and 0.48\%, respectively. These DMRs related to genes with functional implications for psychological stress response, and tissue inheritance of these DMRs passed paternal disorders epigenetically to offspring. More importantly, these DMRs evaded offspring embryonic reprogramming through erasure and subsequent reestablishment, but not via un-erasure way. Nonetheless, their reestablishment proportions in the primitive streak (E7.5) stage were altered. Furthermore, sncRNA-seq revealed that stress-induced tsRNA, miRNA and rsRNA dysregulation in paternal sperm might play important roles in DMRs occurrence and paternal inheritance. These finding implied that sperm epigenetic alterations contribute to inter- and transgenerational effects of paternal exposure to long-term psychological stress, and highlighted the possible underlying molecular mechanism.},

However, the relationship between the methylation dynamics in germline development and the germline mutation rate remains unexplored. In this study, we used whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data of cells at 13 stages of human germline development and rare variants from the 1000 Genome Project as proxies for germline mutations to investigate the correlation between dynamic methylation levels and germline mutation rates at different scales. At the singlesite level, we found a significant correlation between methylation and the germline point mutation rate at CpG sites during germline developmental stages. Then we explored the mutability of methylation dynamics in all stages. Our results also showed a broad correlation between the regional methylation level and the rate of C . T mutation at CpG sites in all genomic regions, especially in intronic regions; a similar link was also seen at all chromosomal levels. Our findings indicate that the dynamic DNA methylome during human germline development has a broader mutational impact than is commonly assumed.},

  abstract = {Caste differentiation in social hymenopterans is an intriguing example of phenotypic plasticity. However, the co-ordination among gene regulatory factors to mediate caste differentiation remains inconclusive. In this study, we determined the role of gene regulation and related epigenetic processes in pre-imaginal caste differentiation in the primitively eusocial bumblebee Bombus terrestris. By combining RNA-Seq data from Illumina and PacBio and accurately quantifying methylation at whole-genomic base pair resolution, we found that queens, workers, and drones mainly differentiate in gene expression but not in alternative splicing and DNA methylation. Gynes are the most distinct with the lowest global level of whole-genomic methylation and with the largest number of caste-specific transcripts and alternative splicing events. By contrast, workers exhibit few uniquely expressed or alternatively spliced genes. Moreover, several genes involved in hormone and neurotransmitter metabolism are related to caste differentiation, whereas several neuropeptides are linked with sex differentiation. Despite little genome-wide association among differential gene expression, splicing, and differential DNA methylation, the overlapped gene ontology (GO) terms point to nutrition-related activity. Therefore, variations in gene regulation correlate with the behavioral differences among castes and highlight the specialization of toolkit genes in bumblebee gynes at the beginning of the adult stage.},

  abstract = {Most primates are social species whose reproduction is influenced by their social relationships. The cotton-top tamarin, Saguinus oedipus, and the common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus, are cooperative breeding species where the family structure alters reproductive function in many ways. While primates receive social effects on reproduction via all sensory stimuli, the marmosets and tamarins are particularly influenced by olfactory/chemosensory stimuli. The olfactory sensory processing is the ``social glue'' that keeps the family together. This review describes a number of studies using the marmosets and tamarins at the University of Wisconsin to demonstrate how odor cues are used for altering reproductive function and dysfunction. Several key studies will be discussed to show the role of odor signaling of the female reproductive state. The suppressive effects of odors are mediated by priming odors and can cause a suppressive influence on ovulation in young females via their mother's scents. Additionally, odor cues from the infant function as priming odors to ensure that fathers and mothers are present and receptive to their parental care duties. Neural pathways occur via the processing of priming odors that consequently stimulate alterations in the behavioral and endocrine response to the stimuli. The dynamics of the cooperative breeding system ensure that offspring have essential needs met and that they develop in a family environment. Olfactory communication plays a key role in maintenance of the social system of Callitrichid monkeys. Am. J. Primatol. 75:202-211, 2013. {\copyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Characterizing inbreeding depression in wildlife populations can be critical to their conservation. Coefficients of individual inbreeding can be estimated from genomewide marker data. The degree to which sensitivity of inbreeding coefficients to population genetic substructure alters estimates of inbreeding depression in wild populations is not well understood. Using generalized linear models, we tested the power of two frequently used inbreeding coefficients that are calculated from genome-wide SNP markers, FH and F{\textasciicircum}III, to predict four fitness traits estimated over two decades in an isolated population of the critically endangered Leadbeater's possum. FH estimates inbreeding as excess observed homozygotes relative to equilibrium expectations, whereas F{\textasciicircum}III quantifies allelic similarity between the gametes that formed an individual, and upweights rare homozygotes. We estimated FH and F{\textasciicircum}III from 1,575 genome-wide SNP loci in individuals with fitness trait data (N = 179--237 per trait), and computed revised coefficients, FHby group and F{\textasciicircum}IIIby group, adjusted for population genetic substructure by calculating them separately within two different genetic groups of individuals identified in the population. Using FH or F{\textasciicircum}III in the models, inbreeding depression was detected for survival to sexual maturity, longevity and whether individuals bred during their lifetime. F{\textasciicircum}IIIby group (but not FHby group) additionally revealed significant inbreeding depression for lifetime reproductive output (total offspring assigned to each individual). Estimates of numbers of lethal equivalents indicated substantial inbreeding load, but differing between inbreeding estimators. Inbreeding depression, declining population size, and low and declining genetic diversity suggest that genetic rescue may assist in preventing extinction of this unique Leadbeater's possum population.},

  abstract = {Ethnic minorities fare less well on average in the labour market than their white British counterparts. Experimental research shows that employers discriminate against ethnic minority applicants while hiring, but it is impossible to say from these studies how much of minorities' overall disadvantage -- which reflects compositional differences and search behaviour as well as hiring -- is due to discrimination. This article connects results from two UK-based field experiments with ethnic penalties estimated from comparable samples of the UK Labour Force Survey and Understanding Society to show the relation between hiring discrimination and labour market penalties, for several ethnic minority groups. Higher hiring discrimination is indeed associated with worse ethnic employment penalties, but similarly discriminated against groups do not necessarily face the same ethnic penalties. We provide a discussion of possible reasons for this variation. Our research points to socio-economic resources and supply-side differences among ethnic groups as plausible explanations.},
