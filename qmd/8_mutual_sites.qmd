**Are there CpG sites that are significant in multiple models?**

It would be interesting to see whether a CpG site is both associated with reproductive effort as well as mating success, with physiological changes and mating success, or with both reproductive effort and physiological changes. For example, a CpG site could be significantly associated with fighting rate and the change in methylation might also be associated with reproductive success.

I checked whether there are mutual significant CpG sites among models, and find the following:

-   1 CpG site is both significant for lek attendance and annual mating success

-   2 CpG sites are significant for changes in body mass and annual mating success
-   2 CpG sites are significant for changes in Microfilaria spp. and annual mating success
-   1 CpG site is both significant for changes in HCT and annual mating success

-   1 CpG site is both significant for lek attendance and changes in body mass

-   1 CpG site is significant for lek centrality, changes in IgG and annual mating success

I plotted the raw data below, where on the left panels you can see the relationship between the effort / physiological trait and delta methylation, and on the right side the relationship between delta methylation and AMS for the same CpG site.

## Raw data

### Reproductive effort vs AMS

### Physiological changes vs AMS

### Highlight

There is one CpG site significant for three things: lek centrality, changes in IgG and annual mating success
