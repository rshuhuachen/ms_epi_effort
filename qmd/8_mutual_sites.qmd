**Are there CpG sites that are significant in multiple models?**

It would be interesting to see whether a CpG site is both associated with reproductive effort as well as mating success, with physiological changes and mating success, or with both reproductive effort and physiological changes. For example, a CpG site could be significantly associated with fighting rate and the change in methylation might also be associated with reproductive success.

I checked whether there are mutual significant CpG sites among models, and find the following:
